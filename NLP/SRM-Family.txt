8/31/19, 3:44 PM - B A L A: This is interesting info :

1994

The President of India, Shri Shankar Dayal Sharma visited Muscat on an official trip -

When the Air India flight landed, 3 rather unusual incidents took place:

1. The Sultan of Oman never goes to the airport to receive dignitaries of any country - never. But he made an exception this time and went to the airport to receive the President of India!

2. When the flight landed, the Sultan of Oman climbed up the steps and received the President from his seat!

3 . After alighting the flight there was a car with the chauffeur standing. But the Sultan signalled the driver to move and he himself drove the car with President as his passenger!

Later when the reporters questioned the Sultan why he broke so many protocols, the Sultan replied, “I did not go to the airport to receive Mr. Sharma because he was India’s President. I studied in India and learnt so many things, when I was studying in Pune, Mr. Sharma was my Professor - that is why I did this!”

That is the power of being a teacher.

It' *s may be a hardcore recession** this time, which already spreads it's poison in the economy of India. Almost 13.67percent fall in overall economic marker is recorded. Foreign exchange, repo rate is also indicating that crisis started. Already 17Lakh of employee lost job in last quarter. Prepare and get ready for the bad times...
You can follow this steps-
1. Try to minimise extra expenses
2. Try to avoid big buying in next 6month
3. Avoid investment now, nobody knows SIP and trading will bring what amount of loss,since all are depends on the recovery.
4. Don't buy gold now, likely the price will fall from December
5. Mediocre people, small business will suffer the most, so make your budget tight.
6. Online purchase can be risky, since sites are already in loss.
7. Convert / consume all your digital money( Paytm,Gpay etcetc) into physical fund.
8. Priorities your family expenses.
9. Stay alert - snatching on roads,robbery will increase from coming festive season.
10. Try to cumulate at least your 6 month expenses from now on. The situation may be worst from November December 2019. It may persist till mid of 2020. 

11. Atlast not the least - Don't quit your job without a strong alternative on hand.

Please be alert, and circulate it like a responsible citizen, with your close friends.

With great enthusiasm the event management team is gearing up for  the teachers’ day programme..
Various events have been planned for the faculties to enjoy unwind and relax and the programme will succeed only if there is active involvement and participation of all faculty members.
Therefore I expect that each and every faculty should perform or participate in any one of the event and make the teachers’ day programme a huge success

Happy teachers day

You are a priviliged lot.😊 

There are very few people in the world who get to make a difference and YOU make a difference.

We all talk about change and YOU are the harbingers of change

Society is changing and it is YOU who ensure that the fundamentals of creating a knowledgeable, empathetic and committed citizenry stay strong.

It is YOU who provide the children the finger to hold as they start their journey towards their goal with the parents doing the same on the other side.

For me it is not just the one day that the teachers are to be saluted, it is every single day that they must be credited for the selfless committment they have in nurturing the latent talents of the children of today who will lead this country to greatness tomorrow.

I am very proud to be a teacher.

Happy Teachers day with loads of love, best wishes and gratitude.

9/7/19, 6:12 PM - Ranjana Mam: Why should companies recruit people over 50 for senior and responnsible positions?

Because they are more productive than those below 50!

A massive study in America found that *the most productive age in a man's life is 60 - 70*

 *From 70 - 80 is the 2nd most productive age.*

*The 3rd most productive age is 50 - 60.*

The average age of a Nobel Prize winner is 62. 

The average age of a CEO in a Fortune 500 company is 63.

*The average age of the pastors of the 100 biggest churches in America is 71*. 

*The average age of Pope's is 76*

This tells us somehow *God has designed that the best years of your life are 60 - 80!*

 *It is when you do your best work.*

*A study published in NEJM found that at 60 you reach your peak of potential and continue up to 80!*

*So, if you are between 60 - 70, or 70-80, you have the best and second best years of your life with you!*

आम बेचकर पढ़ाई की, नंगे पांव कॉलेज गए और भारत को चांद के इतना करीब लेकर आ गए साइंटिस्ट के. सिवन
आप भारत के मिशन चंद्रयान 2 की पूरी कहानी जानते हैं. नहीं जानते हैं, तो यहां पढ़ सकते हैं. ये भी जानते हैं कि चंद्रयान 2 का ऑर्बिटर तो चंद्रमा के चक्कर लगा रहा है, लेकिन चंद्रयान 2 के लैंडर विक्रम से वैज्ञानिकों का संपर्क टूट गया है. इस पूरी प्रक्रिया में एक आदमी प्रधानमंत्री मोदी के गले लगकर रोते हुए दिखा, जिनका नाम है के सिवन. ISRO यानी कि इंडियन स्पेस रिसर्च ऑर्गनाइजेशन के मुखिया. ये वो आदमी है, जिसने उस कारनामे को करने का हौसला दिखाया, जिसे करने की कोशिश दुनिया में अब तक कोई भी देश नहीं कर पाया है. ये दीगर बात है कि वो आदमी अपनी कोशिशों में पूरी तरह से कामयाब नहीं हो पाया, लेकिन उसने और उसकी टीम ने जो किया है, अब पूरी दुनिया उसकी मिसाल दे रही है. लेकिन के सिवन का सफर इतना आसान नहीं रहा है. उनके संघर्ष की दास्तां बेहद लंबी है.
के सिवन का पूरा नाम है कैलाशावादिवो सिवन. कन्याकुमारी में पैदा हुए. गांव का नाम सरक्कालविलाई. परिवार गरीब था. इतना कि के सिवन की पढ़ाई के लिए भी पैसे नहीं थे. गांव के ही सरकारी स्कूल में पढ़ते थे. 8वीं तक वहीं पढ़े. आगे की पढ़ाई के लिए गांव से बाहर निकलना था. लेकिन घर में पैसे नहीं थे. के सिवन को पढ़ने के लिए फीस जुटानी थी. और इसके लिए उन्होंने पास के बाजार में आम बेचना शुरू किया. जो पैसे मिलते, उससे अपनी फीस चुकाते. इसरो चेयरमैन बनने के बाद के सिवन ने अंग्रेजी अखबार डेक्कन क्रॉनिकल से बातचीत के दौरान बताया था-
‘मैं एक गरीब परिवार में पैदा हुआ था. मेरे बड़े भाई ने पैसे न होने की वजह से मेरी पढ़ाई रुकवा दी. मेरे पिता कैलाशा वादिवू एक किसान थे, जो पास के बाजार में आम बेचते थे. मैं साइकल पर आम लेकर जाता था और उसे बाजार में बेचकर अपनी पढ़ाई की फीस चुकाता था.’
आम बेचकर पढ़ाई करते-करते के सिवन ने इंटरमीडिएट तो कर लिया, लेकिन ग्रैजुएशन के लिए और पैसे चाहिए थे. पैसे न होने की वजह से उनके पिता ने कन्याकुमारी के नागरकोइल के हिंदू कॉलेज में उनका दाखिला करवा दिया. और जब वो हिंदू कॉलेज में मैथ्स में बीएससी करने पहुंचे, तो उनके पैरों में चप्पलें आईं. धोती-कुर्ता और चप्पल. इससे पहले के सिवन के पास कभी इतने पैसे नहीं हुए थे कि वो अपने लिए चप्पल तक खरीद सकें. सिवन ने पढ़ाई की और अपने परिवार के पहले ग्रैजुएट बने. मैथ्स में 100 में 100 नंबर लेकर आए. और फिर उनका मन बदल गया.
अब उन्हें मैथ्स नहीं, साइंस की पढ़ाई करनी थी. और इसके लिए वो पहुंच गए एमआईटी. यानी कि मद्रास इंस्टीट्यूट ऑफ टेक्नॉलजी. वहां उन्हें स्कॉलरशिप मिली और इसकी बदौलत उन्होंने एरोऩॉटिकल इंजीनियरिंग (हवाई जहाज बनाने वाली पढ़ाई) में बीटेक किया.  साल था 1980. एमआईटी में उन्हें एस नमसिम्हन, एनएस वेंकटरमन, ए नागराजन, आर धनराज, और के जयरमन जैसे प्रोफेसर मिले, जिन्होंने के सिवन को गाइड किया. बीटेक करने के बाद के सिवन ने एयरोस्पेस इंजीनियरिंग में मास्टर्स किया बैंगलोर के इंडियन इंस्टीट्यूट ऑफ साइंस से. और जब के सिवन आईआईएस बैंगलोर से बाहर निकले तो वो वो एयरोनॉटिक्स के बड़े साइंटिस्ट बन चुके थे. धोती-कुर्ता छूट गया था और वो अब पैंट-शर्ट पहनने लगे थे.  ISRO यानी इंडियन स्पेस रिसर्च ऑर्गनाइजेश के साथ उन्होंने अपनी नौकरी शुरू की. पहला काम मिला पीएसएलवी बनाने की टीम में. पीएसएलवी यानी कि पोलर सेटेलाइट लॉन्च वीकल. ऐसा रॉकेट जो भारत के सेटेलाइट्स को अंतरिक्ष में भेज सके. के सिवन और उनकी टीम इस काम में कामयाब रही.
के सिवन ने रॉकेट को कक्षा में स्थापित करने के लिए एक सॉफ्टवेयर बनाया, जिसे नाम दिया गया सितारा. उनका बनाया सॉफ्टवेयर बेहद कामयाब रहा और भारत के वैज्ञानिक जगत में इसकी चर्चा होने लगी. इस दौरान भारत के वैज्ञानिक पीएसएलवी से एक कदम आगे बढ़कर जीएसएलवी की तैयारी कर रहे थे. जीएसएलवी यानी कि जियोसेटेलाइट लॉन्च वीकल. 18 अप्रैल, 2001 को जीएसएलवी की टेस्टिंग की गई. लेकिन टेस्टिंग फेल हो गई, क्योंकि जिस जगह पर वैज्ञानिक इसे पहुंचाना चाहते थे, नहीं पहुंचा पाए. के सिवन को इसी काम में महारत हासिल थी. जीएसएलवी को लॉन्च करने का जिम्मा दिया गया के सिवन को. और उन्होंने कर दिखाया. इसके बाद से ही के सिवन को ISRO का रॉकेट मैन कहा जाने लगा.
इसके बाद के सिवन और उनकी टीम ने एक और प्रोजेक्ट पर काम करना शुरू किया. प्रोजेक्ट था रियूजेबल लॉन्च वीकल बनाना. मतलब कि लॉन्च वीकल से एक बार सेटेलाइट छोड़ने के बाद दोबारा उस लॉन्च वीकल का इस्तेमाल किया जा सके. अभी तक किसी भी देश में ऐसा नहीं हो पाया था. के सिवन की अगुवाई में भारत के वैज्ञानिक इसमें जुट गए थे. इस दौरान के सिवन ने साल 2006 में एयरोस्पेस इंजीनियरिंग में आईआईटी बॉम्बे से डॉक्टरी की डिग्री हासिल कर ली. और फिर ISRO में लॉन्च वीकल के लिए ईंधन बनाने वाले डिपार्टमेंट के मुखिया बना दिए गए. तारीख थी 2 जुलाई, 2014. एक साल से भी कम समय का वक्त बीता और के सिवन को विक्रम साराभाई स्पेस सेंटर के मुखिया बना दिए गए. वो स्पेस सेंटर जिसका काम है भारत के सेटेलाइट्स को अंतरिक्ष में भेजने के लिए वीकल यानी कि रॉकेट तैयार करना. वहां अभी के सिवन एक साल भी काम नहीं कर पाए कि उस वक्त के ISRO के मुखिया ए.एस. किरन कुमार का कार्यकाल पूरा हो गया. और फिर 14 जनवरी, 2015 को के सिवन को ISRO का मुखिया नियुक्त किया गया.
खाली वक्त में क्लासिकल तमिल संगीत सुनने और बागवानी करने वाले के सिवन को कई पुरस्कारों से नवाजा गया है. उनकी अगुवाई में ISRO ने 15 फरवरी, 2017 को एक साथ 104 सेटेलाइट अंतरिक्ष में भेजे. ऐसा करके ISRO ने वर्ल्ड रिकॉर्ड बना दिया. और इसके बाद ISRO का सबसे बड़ा मिशन था चंद्रयान 2, जिसे 22 जुलाई, 2019 को ल़ॉन्च किया गया. 2 सितंबर को चंद्रयान दो हिस्सों में बंट गया. पहला हिस्सा था ऑर्बिटर, जिसने चंद्रमा के चक्कर लगाने शुरू कर दिए. दूसरा हिस्सा था लैंडर, जिसे विक्रम नाम दिया गया था. इसे 6-7 सितंबर की रात चांद की सतह पर उतरना था. सब ठीक था कि अचानक संपर्क टूट गया. और फिर जो हुआ, वो दुनिया ने देखा. भावुक पल. ISRO चीफ पीएम मोदी के गले लगकर रो पड़े. सबकुछ उम्मीद के मुताबिक नहीं हुआ. लेकिन ये के सिवन हैं. अपनी ज़िंदगी में भी परेशानियां झेलकर कामयाबी हासिल की है. और अब एक बड़ी कामयाबी से थोड़ा सा चूक गए. लेकिन उम्मीद पर दुनिया कायम है. और हम भी. कि हम एक दिन कामयाब होंगे. ज़रूर होंगे.

थैंक यू ISRO, पूरी दुनिया को सत्य का दर्शन कराने के लिए। इस खूबसूरत धरा को हम सब को बचाना है। इसी संकल्प से हम सब अपने जीवन का लक्ष्य तय करें कि हम इस धरती पर भला आये क्यों हैं। 
और हां, चन्द्रयान-2 अभी हम लोगों को बहुत कुछ और भी बताने वाला है। धीरज रखियेगा। आपको गर्व होना चाहिए कि आप गौरवशाली भारत देश के निवासी हैं। 
ये सारे चित्र उत्तर प्रदेश शासन के अपर मुख्य सचिव (सूचना, पर्यटन व धर्मार्थ कार्य) द्वारा आज सुबह पत्रकारों को उपलब्ध कराए गए हैं। उनका आभार।

9/15/19, 4:57 PM - Swati Bhatt: At the age of 57, John B. Goodenough invented the lithium battery which powers all our smart phones, tablets and laptops - as well as electric cars.

37 years later at the age of 94, John has unveiled a new, ultra-efficient, low cost battery which uses a sodium or lithium coated glass electrolyte. It will dwarf his original invention and make it redundant.

The new glass battery will allow electric cars to go three times the distance, and recharge in minutes instead of hours. It's also far safer as it won't explode and can operate in sub-zero temperatures.

The new glass battery will power our future solar powered and electric vehicles, homes and industries.

But John isn't finished yet. He still works every day as a Professor at the University of Texas.

John believes humanity has a 30 year window to come up with an even more powerful "super battery" to take us entirely off fossil fuels, before the environmental damage we are creating becomes irreversible, and says, "I want to solve this problem before my chips are in ..... I still have time to go."

So if you ever think it's too late to be successful, just remember John B. Goodenough.

एक बार एक इंटरव्यू में
नसीरुद्दीन शाह ने कहा कि
अमिताभ बच्चन का सार्थक
सिनेमा में कोई खास योगदान
नहीं रहा, क्योंकि वो विशुद्ध
व्यावसायिक अभिनेता हैं ।

इसके बाद पत्रकार ने
अमिताभ बच्चन को तुरंत
यह बात बताई और उनकी
प्रतिक्रिया जाननी चाही ??
अमिताभ बच्चन ने कहा,
"जब नसीरुद्दीन शाह जैसा
अंतरराष्ट्रीय अभिनेता कुछ
कहता है तो आत्म मंथन
करना चाहिये, प्रतिक्रिया
नहीं देना चाहिये" ..

एक बार गुलज़ार से किसी
ने उनके पांच सबसे
पसंदीदा गीतकारों के नाम
पूछे ।
गुलज़ार ने पांच
गीतकार गिनवा दिये,
उसमे जावेद अख्तर साहब का
नाम नहीं था । 
फिर क्या था पत्रकार ने ये
बात जावेद अख्तर साहब को
बताई और प्रतिक्रिया चाही ?
जावेद अख्तर ने कहा,
इस बात पर बस मैं ये कह
सकता हूँ कि गुलज़ार साहब
की लिस्ट में जगह पाने के
लिए मुझे अभी और मेहनत
करनी होगा ।

इसे कहते है....
"व्यक्तित्व"..
इसे कहते है..
"सकारात्मक सोच"....

"जरूरी नहीं है कि कीचड़
फेंकने वाले पर कीचड़ ही
फेंका जाए"...

बोलना और प्रतिक्रिया
करना जरूरी है लेकिन
संयम और सभ्यता का 
दामन नहीं छूटना चाहिये ।

प्रेम की धारा, बहती है जिस दिल में,
चर्चा उसकी होती है, हर महफ़िल मे.....

10/5/19, 7:38 AM - Naresh Sharma: एक  कॉलेज में अर्थशास्त्र के एक प्रोफेसर ने अपने एक बयान में कहा – “उसने पहले कभी किसी छात्र को फेल नहीं किया था, पर हाल ही में उसने एक पूरी की पूरी क्लास को फेल कर दिया है l”

........ क्योंकि उस क्लास ने दृढ़तापूर्वक यह कहा था कि “समाजवाद सफल होगा और न कोई गरीब होगा और न कोई धनी होगा”, क्योंकि उन सब का दृढ़ विश्वास है कि यह सबको समान करने वाला एक महान सिद्धांत है.....

तब प्रोफेसर ने कहा– "अच्छा ठीक है ! आओ हम क्लास में समाजवाद के अनुरूप एक प्रयोग करते हैं- सफलता पाने वाले सभी छात्रों के विभिन्न ग्रेड (अंकों) का औसत निकाला जाएगा और सबको वही एक काॅमन ग्रेड दिया जायेगा। ”

पहली परीक्षा के बाद.....
सभी ग्रेडों का औसत निकाला गया और प्रत्येक छात्र को B ग्रेड प्राप्त हुआl

जिन छात्रों ने कठिन परिश्रम किया था वे परेशान हो गए और जिन्होंने कम पढ़ाई की थी वे खुश हुए l

दूसरी परीक्षा के लिए कम पढ़ने वाले छात्रों ने पहले से भी और कम पढ़ाई की और जिहोंने कठिन परिश्रम किया था, उन्होंने यह तय किया कि वे भी मुफ़्त का ग्रेड प्राप्त करेंगे और उन्होंने भी कम पढ़ाई की l

दूसरी परीक्षा में ...... 
सभी का काॅमन ग्रेड D आया l
इससे कोई खुश नहीं था और सब एक-दूसरे को कोसने लगे।

जब तीसरी परीक्षा हुई....... 
तो काॅमन ग्रेड F हो गया l

जैसे-जैसे परीक्षाएँ आगे बढ़ने लगीं, स्कोरकभी ऊपर नहीं उठा, बल्कि और भी नीचे गिरता रहा। आपसी कलह, आरोप-प्रत्यारोप, गाली-गलौज और एक-दूसरे से नाराजगी के परिणाम स्वरूप कोई भी नहीं पढ़ता था, क्योंकि कोई भी छात्र अपने परिश्रम से दूसरे को लाभ नहीं पहुंचाना चाहता था l

अंत में सभी आश्चर्यजनक रूप से फेल हो गए और प्रोफेसर ने उन्हें बताया कि - 
"इसी तरह *समाजवाद* की नियति भी अंततोगत्वा फेल होने की ही है, क्योंकि इनाम जब बहुत बड़ा होता है तो सफल होने के लिए किया जाने वाला उद्यम भी बहुत बड़ा करना होता है l
परन्तु जब सरकारें मेहनत के सारे लाभ मेहनत करने वालों से छीन कर वंचितों और निकम्मों में बाँट देगी, तो कोई भी न तो मेहनत करना चाहेगा और न ही सफल होने की कोशिश करेगा l"

उन्होंने यह भी समझाया कि - 
*" इससे निम्नलिखित पाँच सिद्धांत भी निष्कर्षित व प्रतिपादित होते हैं -*

*1.* यदि आप राष्ट्र को समृद्ध और समाज को को सक्षम बनाना चाहते हैं, तो किसी भी व्यक्ति को उसकी समृद्धि से बेदखल करके गरीब को समृद्ध बनाने का क़ानून नहीं बना सकते।

*2.* जो व्यक्ति बिना कार्य किए कुछ प्राप्त करता है, तो वह अवश्य ही अधिक परिश्रम करने वाले किसी अन्य व्यक्ति के इनाम को छीन कर उसे दिया जाता है।

*3.* सरकार तब तक किसी को कोई वस्तु नहीं दे सकती जब तक वह उस वस्तु को किसी अन्य से छीन न ले।

*4.* आप सम्पदा को बाँट कर उसकी वृद्धि नहीं कर सकते।

*5.* जब किसी राष्ट्र की आधी आबादी यह समझ लेती है कि उसे कोई काम नहीं करना है, क्योंकि बाकी आधी आबादी उसकी देख-भाल जो कर रही है और बाकी आधी आबादी यह सोच कर ज्यादा अच्छा कार्य नहीं कर रही कि उसके कर्म का फल किसी दूसरे को मिलना है, तो वहीं से उस राष्ट्र के पतन और अंततोगत्वा अंत की शुरुआत हो जाती है।

10/6/19, 9:59 AM - Ankit Auto HOD: May be a repeat.     But worth reading & understand the moral 

An engineer in a car manufacturing company designs a world class car. The CEO is impressed with the outcome and praised him a lot. 

While trying to bring out the car from the manufacturing area to the showroom, they realised that the car is 2 inches taller than the entrance.

The engineer felt bad that he didn't notice this one before creating the car.

The CEO was confused on how to take it outside of the manufacturing area.

The painter said that they can bring out the car and there will be a few scratches on top of the car which could be touched up later on.

The engineer said that they can break the entrance, take the car out, and later re-do it.

The CEO was not convinced with any ideas and felt like it is a bad sign to break or scratch. 

A Watchman was observing all the drama & slowly approached the CEO.  He wanted to give an idea if they had no problem. 

They wondered what this guy would tell them that the experts could not give.

The watchman said "The car is only a few inches taller than the entrance so, simply release the air in the tyre, the height of the car will sink and can be easily taken out"...

Everyone clapped!!!

Don't analyse the problems only from an expert point of view alone.

There is always a layman's outlook that gives an alternate solution at a given point of time...

Life issues are also the same....

😀 Think Simple...
Do Simple and Live Simple 
Because Originally we are Happy Souls..

Release *some Air* ... It could be our 'anger' .... our 'disappointments'... our  'egos'... Our 'confusions' ..

In the end it's all about   "Adjusting The Height" ( *Attitude* ), to make things easier in life and uncomplicate the things in life. ✨

"Life is beautiful" .... "Enjoy every moment" ....  "Seasons change" ..... "Situations Change"..... 🙏🏻🙏🏻😊👍🏻✨✨♻

10/8/19, 7:11 PM - Sahab Sing 2: कहा जाता है कि रावण भी ब्रह्मज्ञानी था। क्या रावण भी रावण उसकी मर्जी से नहीं था? क्या रामलीला सच में ही राम की लीला थी?

निश्चित ही, रावण ब्रह्मज्ञानी था। और रावण के साथ बहुत अनाचार हुआ है। और दक्षिण में जो आज रावण के प्रति फिर से समादर का भाव पैदा हो रहा है, वह अगर ठीक रास्ता ले ले, तो अतीत में हमने जो भूल की है, उसका सुधार हो सकता है।

लेकिन वह भी गलत रास्ता लेता मालूम पड़ रहा है दक्षिण का आंदोलन। वे रावण को तो आदर देना शुरू कर रहे हैं, राम को अनादर देना शुरू कर रहे हैं। आदमी की मूढ़ता का अंत नहीं है, वह अतियों पर डोलता है। वह कभी संतुलित तो हो ही नहीं सकता।

यहां तुम रावण को जलाते रहे हो, वहां अब उन्होंने राम को जलाना शुरू किया है। तुमने एक भूल की थी, अब वे दूसरी भूल कर रहे हैं।

रावण ब्रह्मज्ञानी था। यह भी परमात्मा की मर्जी थी कि वह यह पार्ट अदा करे। उसने यह भली तरह अदा किया। और कहते हैं, जब राम के बाण से वह मरा, तो उसने कहा कि मेरी जन्मों—जन्मों की आकांक्षा पूरी हुई। राम के हाथों मारा जाऊं, इससे बड़ी और कोई आकांक्षा हो भी नहीं सकती। क्योंकि जो राम के हाथ मारा गया, वह सीधा मोक्ष चला जाता है। गुरु के हाथ जो मारा गया, वह और कहां जाएगा!

और जैसे पांडवों को कहा है कृष्ण ने कि मरते हुए भीष्म से जाकर धर्म की शिक्षा ले लो, वैसे ही राम ने लक्ष्मण को भेजा है रावण के पास कि वह मर न जाए, वह परम ज्ञानी है; उससे कुछ ज्ञान के सूत्र ले आ। उस बहती गंगा से थोड़ा तू भी पानी पी ले। लेकिन कठिनाई क्या है? कठिनाई हमारी यह है कि हमारी समझ चुनाव की है। अगर हम राम को चुनते हैं, तो रावण दुश्मन हो गया। अगर हम रावण को चुनते हैं, तो राम दुश्मन हो गए। और दोनों को तो हम चुन नहीं सकते। क्योंकि हमको लगता है, दोनों तो बड़े विरोधी हैं, इनको हम कैसे चुनें!

और जो दोनों को चुन ले, वही रामलीला का सार समझा। क्योंकि रामलीला अकेली राम की लीला नहीं है, रावण के बिना हो भी नहीं सकती। थोडा रावण को हटा लो रामलीला से, फिर रामलीला बिलकुल ठप्प हो जाएगी, वहीं गिर जाएगी। सब सहारे उखड़ जाएंगे।

राम खड़े न हो सकेंगे बिना रावण के। राम को रावण का सहारा है। प्रकाश हो नहीं सकता बिना अंधेरे के। अंधेरा प्रकाश को बड़ा सहारा है। जीवन हो नहीं सकता बिना मृत्यु के। मृत्यु के हाथों पर ही जीवन टिका है। जीवन विपरीत में से चल रहा है।

राम और रावण, मृत्यु और जीवन, दोनों विरोध वस्तुत: विरोधी नहीं हैं, सहयोगी हैं। और जिसने ऐसा देखा, उसी ने समझा कि रामलीला का अर्थ क्या है। तब विरोध नाटक रह जाता है। तब भीतर कोई वैमनस्य नहीं है। न तो राम के मन में कोई वैमनस्य है, न रावण के मन में कोई वैमनस्य है। और इसीलिए तो हमने इस कथा को धार्मिक कहा है। अगर वैमनस्य हो, तो कथा नहीं रही, इतिहास हो गया।

इस फर्क को भी ठीक से समझ लो। पुराण और इतिहास का यही फर्क है। इतिहास साधारण आदमियों की जीवन घटनाएं हैं। वहां संघर्ष है, विरोध है, वैमनस्य है, दुश्मनी है। पुराण! पुराण नाटक है, लीला है। वहां वास्तविक नहीं है वैमनस्य; दिखावा है, खेल है। जो मिला है अभिनय, उसे पूरा करना है।

कथा यह है कि वाल्मीकि ने राम के होने के पहले ही रामायण लिखी। अब जब लिख ही दी थी, तो फिर राम को पूरा करना पड़ा। कर भी क्या सकते थे। जब वाल्मीकि जैसा आदमी लिख दे, तो तुम करोगे क्या! फिर उसको पूरा करना ही पड़ा।

यह बड़ी मीठी बात है। द्रष्टा कह देते हैं, फिर उसे पूरा करना पड़ता है। इसका अर्थ कुल इतना ही है, जैसे कि नाटक की कथा तो पहले ही लिखी होती है, फिर कथा को पूरा करते हैं नाटक में। नाटक में कथा पैदा नहीं होती। कथा पहले पैदा होती है, फिर कथा के अनुसार नाटक चलता है। क्या किसको कहना है, सब तय होता है। जीवन का सारा खेल तय है। क्या होना है, तय है। तुम नाहक ही अपना बोझ उठाए चल रहे हो। अगर तुम समझ लो कि सिर्फ नाटक है जीवन, तो तुम्हारा जीवन रामलीला हो गया, तुम पुराण—पुरुष हो गए, फिर तुम्हारा इतिहास से कोई नाता न रहा। फिर तुम इस भ्रांति में नहीं हो कि तुम कर रहे हो। फिर तुम जानते हो कि जो उसने कहा है, हो रहा है। हम उसकी मर्जी पूरी कर रहे हैं। अगर वह रावण बनने को कहे, तो ठीक।

रावण को तुम मार तो नहीं डालते! जो आदमी रावण का पार्ट करता है रामलीला में, उसको तुम मार तो नहीं डालते कि इसने रावण का पार्ट किया है, इसको मार डालों। जैसे ही मंच के बाहर आया, बात खतम हो गई। अगर उसने पार्ट अच्छा किया, तो उसे भी तगमे देते हो।

असली सवाल पार्ट अच्छा करने का है। राम का हो कि रावण का, यह बात अर्थपूर्ण नहीं है। ढंग से पूरा किया जाए _ कुशलता से पूरा किया जाए। अभिनय पूरा—पूरा हो, तो तुम पुराण—पुरुष हो गए। लड़ो बिना वैमनस्य के, संघर्ष करो बिना किसी अपने मन के; जहां जीवन ले जाए बहो। तब तुम्हारे जीवन में लीला आ गई। लीला आते ही निर्भार हो जाता है मन। लीला आते ही चित्त की सब उलझनें कट जाती हैं। जब खेल ही है, तो चिंता क्या रही! फिर एक सपना हो जाता है।

इसी अर्थ में हमने संसार को माया कहा है। माया का अर्थ इतना ही है कि तुम माया की तरह इसे लेना। अगर तुम इसे माया की तरह ले सको, तो भीतर तुम ब्रह्म को खोज लोगे। अगर तुमने इसे सत्य की तरह लिया, तो तुम भीतर के ब्रह्म को गंवा दोगे..ओशो..

जब मन में हो मौज बहारों की
चमकाएँ चमक सितारों की,
जब ख़ुशियों के शुभ घेरे हों
तन्हाई  में  भी  मेले  हों,
आनंद की आभा होती है 
    *उस रोज़ 'दिवाली' होती है ।*

       जब प्रेम के दीपक जलते हों
       सपने जब सच में बदलते हों,
       मन में हो मधुरता भावों की
       जब लहके फ़सलें चावों की,
       उत्साह की आभा होती है 
            *उस रोज़ दिवाली होती है ।*

जब प्रेम से मीत बुलाते हों
दुश्मन भी गले लगाते हों,
जब कहींं किसी से वैर न हो
सब अपने हों, कोई ग़ैर न हो,
अपनत्व की आभा होती है
     *उस रोज़ दिवाली होती है ।*

       जब तन-मन-जीवन सज जाएं
       सद्-भाव  के बाजे बज जाएं,
       महकाए ख़ुशबू ख़ुशियों की
      मुस्काएं चंदनिया सुधियों की,
      तृप्ति  की  आभा होती  है
          *उस रोज़ 'दिवाली' होती है .*।



  दिपावली की अनन्त शुभ कामनायें

11/19/19, 7:28 AM - Prof Vinay Sharma: सर! मुझे पहचाना?"

"कौन?"

"सर, मैं आपका स्टूडेंट। 40 साल पहले का 

"ओह! अच्छा। आजकल ठीक से दिखता नही बेटा और याददाश्त भी कमज़ोर हो गयी है। इसलिए नही पहचान पाया। खैर। आओ, बैठो। क्या करते हो आजकल?" उन्होंने उसे प्यार से बैठाया और पीठ पर हाथ फेरते हुए पूछा।

"सर, मैं भी आपकी ही तरह टीचर बन गया हूँ।"

"वाह! यह तो अच्छी बात है लेकिन टीचर की तनख़ाह तो बहुत कम होती है फिर तुम कैसे...?"

"सर। जब मैं सातवीं क्लास में था तब हमारी कलास में एक वाक़िआ हुआ था। उस से आपने मुझे बचाया था। मैंने तभी टीचर बनने का इरादा कर लिया था। वो वाक़िआ मैं आपको याद दिलाता हूँ। आपको मैं भी याद आ जाऊँगा।"

"अच्छा! क्या हुआ था तब?"

"सर, सातवीं में हमारी क्लास में एक बहुत अमीर लड़का पढ़ता था। जबकि हम बाक़ी सब बहुत ग़रीब थे। एक दिन वोह बहुत महंगी घड़ी पहनकर आया था और उसकी घड़ी चोरी हो गयी थी। कुछ याद आया सर?"

"सातवीं कक्षा?"

"हाँ सर। उस दिन मेरा दिल उस घड़ी पर आ गया था और खेल के पीरियड में जब उसने वह घड़ी अपने पेंसिल बॉक्स में रखी तो मैंने मौक़ा देखकर वह घड़ी चुरा ली थी।  
उसके बाद आपका पीरियड था। उस लड़के ने आपके पास घड़ी चोरी होने की शिकायत की। आपने कहा कि जिसने भी वह घड़ी चुराई है उसे वापस कर दो। मैं उसे सज़ा नहीं दूँगा। लेकिन डर के मारे मेरी हिम्मत ही न हुई घड़ी वापस करने की।"

"फिर आपने कमरे का दरवाज़ा बंद किया और हम सबको एक लाइन से आँखें बंद कर खड़े होने को कहा और यह भी कहा कि आप सबकी जेब देखेंगे लेकिन जब तक घड़ी मिल नहीं जाती तब तक कोई भी अपनी आँखें नहीं खोलेगा वरना उसे स्कूल से निकाल दिया जाएगा।"

"हम सब आँखें बन्द कर खड़े हो गए। आप एक-एक कर सबकी जेब देख रहे थे। जब आप मेरे पास आये तो मेरी धड़कन तेज होने लगी। मेरी चोरी पकड़ी जानी थी। अब जिंदगी भर के लिए मेरे ऊपर चोर का ठप्पा लगने वाला था। मैं पछतावे से भर उठा था। उसी वक्त जान देने का इरादा कर लिया था लेकिन....लेकिन मेरी जेब में घड़ी मिलने के बाद भी आप लाइन के आख़िर तक सबकी जेब देखते रहे। और घड़ी उस लड़के को वापस देते हुए कहा, "अब ऐसी घड़ी पहनकर स्कूल नहीं आना और जिसने भी यह चोरी की थी वह दोबारा ऐसा काम न करे। इतना कहकर आप फिर हमेशा की तरह पढाने लगे थे।"कहते कहते उसकी आँख भर आई।

वह रुंधे गले से बोला, "आपने मुझे सबके सामने शर्मिंदा होने से बचा लिया। आगे भी कभी किसी पर भी आपने मेरा चोर होना जाहिर न होने दिया। आपने कभी मेरे साथ फ़र्क़ नहीं किया। उसी दिन मैंने तय कर लिया था कि मैं आपके जैसा टीचर ही बनूँगा।"

"हाँ हाँ...मुझे याद आया।" उनकी आँखों मे चमक आ गयी। फिर चकित हो बोले, "लेकिन बेटा... मैं आजतक नहीं जानता था कि वह चोरी किसने की थी क्योंकि...जब मैं तुम सबकी जेब देख कर रहा था तब मैंने भी अपनी आँखें बंद कर ली थीं।"

12/7/19, 8:55 PM - B A L A: _An engineer was removing the engine parts from a motorcycle._
_Suddenly he saw a famous heart surgeon in his shop. He went to him & said.. "Look at this engine... I opened its heart, took the valves out, repaired and put them back"...So why do I get such a small salary? and u get huge sums_....! 


The doctor smiled at the engineer and came close to his ear and said.... "Try the same when the engine is running_."


The engineer smiled back came close to doctors ear and said_ 
_I can pick any dead engine and make it alive . . . . . . .  can you_ ???

12/28/19, 7:43 AM - +91 97553 92636: While writing a date in the upcoming year 2020, we should write in its full format, e.g. 31/01/2020 and not as 31/01/20., bcoz anyone can change it to 31/01/2000 or 31/01/2019 or in between any year to suit his convenience.

So be cautious about this. Don't write and also don't accept it in any documents, lest it could lose its importance.

This problem will persist only during the year 2020.

Today’s Republic Day Programme was yet another exhibition of great efforts and effective implementation of creative ideas by the event management team of our institution.. I appreciate all the team members for their contribution .. Despite the fact that the students have their CT -1 tomorrow, the event management team managed to gather the hostellers and I applaud their enthusiastic attitude. My appreciation goes to all other faculty members and staff who supported the event management team in putting up this fantastic show.
I thank our Dean  Dr D K Sharma,  Dr R P Mahapatra and Dr Navin Ahlawat for their moral support in making the Republic Day celebrations a huge success.

Action speaks better than words..
And the time to react is now.

The Heads of all the departments should encourage their students to give positive reviews on Google for NCR campus. As the HoD, you are the ones to interact so closely with your students.. So advise them to rate our campus for the following parameters 

1. Academic environment 
2. Campus Placements 
3. Infrastructure 
4. Hostels 

I expect maximum response from our students which definitely will motivate admission seekers with the insider information about NCR campus..

2/9/20, 8:57 AM - Prof Vinay Sharma: *तत्त्वनिष्ठ*  
 "अजी सुनते हो? राहुल को कम्पनी में जाकर टिफ़िन दे आओगे क्या?" 
"क्यों आज राहुल टिफ़िन लेकर नहीं गया?" 
शरदराव ने पूछा। 
आज राहुल की कम्पनी के चेयरमैन आ रहे हैं, इसलिये राहुल सुबह सात बजे ही निकल गया और इतनी सुबह खाना नहीं बन पाया था।"
" ठीक है। दे आता हूँ मैं।" 
शरदराव ने हाथ का पेपर रख दिया और वे कपड़े बदलने के लिये कमरे में चले गये।" 
पुष्पाबाई ने एक उच्छ्वास छोड़कर राहत की साँस ली। 
शरदराव तैयार हुए हैं, इसका मतलब है कि उसके और राहुल के बीच हुआ विवाद उन्होंने नहीं सुना था।
 विवाद भी कैसा ? हमेशा की तरह राहुल का अपने पिताजी पर दोषारोपण करना और पुष्पाबाई का अपनी पति के पक्ष में बोलना। 
 विषय भी वही! *हमारे पिताजी ने हमारे लिये क्या किया? मेरे लिये क्या किया हैं मेरे बाप ने ?*
  ऐसा गैरसमझ उसके मन में समाया हुआ था। 

  "माँ! मेरे मित्र के पिताजी भी शिक्षक थे, पर देखो उन्होंने कितना बड़ा बंगला बना लिया। नहीं तो, एक ये हमारे नाना (पिताजी) । अभी भी हम किराये के मकान में ही रह रहे हैं।" 
"राहुल, तुझे मालूम है कि तुम्हारे नाना घर में बड़े हैं और दो बहनों और दो भाईयों की शादी का खर्चा भी उन्होंने ही उठाया था। सिवाय इसके, तुम्हारी बहन की शादी का भी खर्चा उन्होंने ही किया था। अपने गांव की जमीन की कोर्ट कचहरी भी लगी ही रही। ये सारी की सारी जवाबदारियाँ किसने उठाई? "
" क्या उपयोग हुआ उसका? उनके भाई - बहन बंगलों में रहते हैं। कभी भी उन्होंने सोचा कि हमारे लिये जिस भाई ने इतने कष्ट उठाये, उसने एक छोटा-सा मकान भी नहीं बनाया, तो हम ही उन्हें एक मकान बना कर दे दें? "

एक क्षण के लिए पुष्पाबाई की आँखें भर आईं। क्या बताए अपने जन्म दिए पुत्र को  जो *"बाप ने क्या किया मेरे लिये"*  पूछ रहा है?
 फिर बोली  .... 
" तुम्हारे नाना ने अपना कर्तव्य निभाया। भाई-बहनों से कभी कोई आशा नहीं रखी। "
राहुल मूर्खों जैसी बात करते हुए बोला — "अच्छा ववह तो ठीक है। उन्होंने हजारों बच्चों की ट्यूशन्स ली। यदि उनसे फीस ले लेते तो आज हम पैसो में खेल रहे होते। आजकल के क्लासेस वालों को देखो। इंपोर्टेड गाड़ियों में घूमते हैं। "
" यह तुम सच बोल रहे हो परन्तु तुम्हारे नाना( पिताजी) के जीवन का आदर्श था, *ज्ञानदान का पैसा नहीं लेना।* उनके इन्हीं आदर्शों के कारण उनकी कितनी प्रसिद्धि हु और कितने पुरस्कार मिले, उसकी कल्पना है तुझे? "

यह सुनते ही राहुल एकदम नाराज हो गया। 
 " क्या चाटना हैं उन पुरस्कारों को? उन पुरस्कारों से घर थोड़े ही बन पायेगा। पड़े हैं धूल खाते हुए। कोई नहीं पूछता उनको।"

इतने में दरवाजे पर दस्तक सुनाई दी। राहुल ने दरवाजा खोला तो शरदराव खड़े थे। नाना ने अपना बोलना तो नहीं सुना, इस डर से राहुल का चेहरा उतर गया। परन्तु, शरदराव बिना कुछ बोले अन्दर चले गये और वह विवाद वहीं खत्म हो गया। 

 ये था पुष्पाबाई और राहुल का कल का झगड़ा, पर आज .... 
 
शरदराव ने टिफ़िन साईकिल पर लटकाया और तपती धूप में औद्योगिक क्षेत्र की राहुल की कम्पनी के लिये निकल पड़े। सात किलोमीटर दूर कंपनी तक पहुंचते - 2 उनका दम फूल गया था। कम्पनी के गेट पर सिक्युरिटी गार्ड ने उन्हें रोक दिया। 

 "राहुल पाटील साहब का टिफ़िन देना है। अन्दर जाऊँ क्या?" 
"अभी नहीं दिया जा सकता।" गार्ड बोला। 
"चेयरमैन साहब आये हुए हैं। उनके साथ मीटिंग चल रही है। किसी भी क्षण वो मीटिंग खत्म करके आ सकते हैं। तुम बाजू में ही रहना। चेयरमैन साहब को आप दिखने नहीं चाहिये।" 
 शरदराव थोडी दूरी पर धूप में ही खड़े रहे। आसपास कहीं भी छांव नहीं थी। 
थोड़ी देर, थोड़ी देर बोलते बोलते एक घंटा निकल गया। पांवों में दर्द उठने लगा था। इसलिये शरदराव वहीं एक तप्त पत्थर पर बैठने लगे, तभी गेट की आवाज आई। शायद मीटिंग खत्म हो गई होगी। 
  चेयरमैन साहेब के पीछे पीछे अधिकारी
और उनके साथ राहुल भी बाहर आया।
उसने अपने पिताजी को वहाँ खड़े देखा तो मन ही मन नाराज हो गया। 
   चेयरमैन साहब कार का दरवाजा खोलकर बैठने ही वाले थे तो उनकी नजर शरदराव की ओर उठ गई। कार में न बैठते हुए वे वैसे ही बाहर खड़े रहे। 
  "वह सामने कौन खडा है?" उन्होंने सिक्युरिटी गार्ड से पूछा। 
"अपने राहुल सर के पिताजी हैं। उनके लिये खाने का टिफ़िन लेकर आये हैं।" गार्ड ने कंपकंपाती आवाज में कहा। 
"बुलवाइये उनको। "
  जो नहीं होना था वह हुआ। राहुल के तन से पसीने की धाराएं बहने लगी। क्रोध और डर से उसका दिमाग सुन्न हुआ जान पड़ने लगा।
 
गार्ड के आवाज देने पर शरदराव पास आये। 
चेयरमैन साहब आगे बढ़े और उनके समीप गये। 
" आप पाटील सर हैं ना? डी. एन. हाईस्कूल में शिक्षक थे। "
" हाँ। आप कैसे पहचानते हो मुझे?" 
कुछ समझने के पहले ही चेयरमैन साहब ने शरदराव के चरण छूए। सभी अधिकारी और राहुल वह दृश्य देखकर अचंभित रह गये। 
"सर, मैं अतिश अग्रवाल। आपका विद्यार्थी । आप मुझे घर पर पढ़ाने आते थे। "
" हाँ.. हाँ.. याद आया। बाप रे! बहुत बड़े व्यक्ति बन गये आप तो ..." 
चेयरमैन हँस दिये। फिर बोले, "सर! आप यहाँ धूप में क्या कर रहे हैं। आईये अंदर चलते हैं। बहुत बातें करनी हैं आपसे। 
सिक्युरिटी! तुमने इन्हें अन्दर क्यों नहीं बिठाया? "
गार्ड ने शर्म से सिर नीचे झुका लिया। 
वह देखकर शरदराव ही बोले —" उनकी कोई गलती नहीं हैं। आपकी मीटिंग चल रही थी। आपको तकलीफ न हो, इसलिये मैं ही बाहर रुक गया। "
"ओके... ओके...!"
चेयरमैन साहब ने शरदराव का हाथ  अपने हाथ में लिया और उनको अपने आलीशन चेम्बर में ले गये। 
"बैठिये सर। अपनी कुर्सी की ओर इंगित करते हुए बोले। 
" नहीं। नहीं। वह कुर्सी आपकी है।" शरदराव सकपकाते हुए बोले। 
"सर, आपके कारण वो कुर्सी मुझे मिली है। तो पहला हक आपका है। "
चेयरमैन साहब ने जबरदस्ती  उन्हें अपनी कुर्सी पर बिठाया। 
" आपको मालूम नहीं होगा, पवार सर.." जनरल मैनेजर की ओर देखते हुए बोले, 
"पाटिल सर नहीं होते तो आज ये कम्पनी नहीं होती और मैं मेरे पिताजी की अनाज की दुकान संभालता रहता। "
राहुल और जी. एम. दोनों आश्चर्य से उनकी ओर देखते ही रहे। 
"स्कूल समय में मैं बहुत ही डब्बू विद्यार्थी था। जैसे तैसे मुझे नवीं कक्षा तक पहुँचाया गया। शहर की सबसे अच्छी क्लासेस में मुझे एडमिशन दिलाया गया। परन्तु मेरा ध्यान कभी पढ़ाई में नहीं लगा। उस पर अमीर बाप की औलाद। दिन भर स्कूल में मौज मस्ती और मारपीट करना। शाम की क्लासेस से बंक मार कर मूवी देखना, यही मेरा शगल था। माँ को वह सहन नहीं होता। उस समय पाटिल सर कड़े अनुशासन और उत्कृष्ट शिक्षक के रूप में प्रसिद्ध थे। माँ ने उनके पास मुझे पढ़ाने की विनती की। परन्तु सर के छोटे से घर में बैठने के लिए जगह ही नहीं थी। इसलिये सर ने पढ़ाने में असमर्थता दर्शाई। माँ ने उनसे बहुत विनती की और हमारे घर आकर पढ़ाने के लिये मुँह मांगी फीस के लिए बोला। सर ने फीस के लिए तो मना कर दिया। परन्तु अनेक प्रकार की विनती करने पर घर आकर पढ़ाने को तैयार हो गये। पहिले दिन सर आये। हमेशा की तरह मैं शैतानी करने लगा। सर ने मेरी अच्छी तरह से धुनाई कर दी। उस धुनाई का असर ऐसा हुआ कि मैं चुपचाप बैठने लगा। तुम्हें कहता हूँ राहुल, पहले हफ्ते में ही मुझे पढ़ने में रुचि जागृत हो गई। तत्पश्चात मुझे पढ़ाई के अतिरिक्त कुछ भी सुझाई नहीं देता था। सर इतना अच्छा पढ़ाते थे। अंग्रेजी, गणित, विज्ञान जैसे विषय जो मुझे कठिन लगते थे वे अब सरल लगने लगे थे। सर कभी आते नहीं थे तो मैं व्यग्र हो जाता था। नवीं कक्षा में मैं दूसरे नम्बर पर आया। माँ-पिताजी को खूब खुशी हुई। मैं तो, जैसे हवा में उडने लगा था। दसवीं में मैंने सारी क्लासेस छोड दी और सिर्फ पाटिल सर से ही पढ़ने लगा था और दसवीं में मेरिट में आकर मैंने  सबको चौंका दिया था।" 
" माय गुडनेस...! पर सर फिर भी आपने सर को फीस नहीं दी? "
  जनरल मैनेजर ने पूछा।           
" मेरे माँ - पिताजी के साथ मैं सर के घर पेड़े लेकर गया। पिताजी ने सर को एक लाख रुपये का चेक दिया। सर ने वह नहीं लिया। उस समय सर क्या बोले वह मुझे आज भी याद है। सर बोले — "मैंने कुछ भी नहीं किया। आपका लडका ही बुद्धिमान है। मैंने सिर्फ़ उसे रास्ता बताया और मैं ज्ञान नहीं बेचता। मैं वह दान देता हूँ। बाद में मैं सर के मार्गदर्शन में ही बारहवीं में पुनः मेरिट में आया। बाद में बी. ई. करने के बाद अमेरिका जाकर एम. एस. किया और अपने शहर में ही यह कम्पनी शुरु की। एक पत्थर को तराशकर सर ने हीरा बना दिया और मैं ही नहीं,  सर ने तो ऐसे अनेक असंख्य हीरे बनाये हैं। सर, आपको कोटी कोटी प्रणाम...!!"
चेयरमैन साहब ने अपनी आँखों में आये अश्रु रूमाल से पोंछे। 
" परन्तु यह बात तो अदभुत ही है क बाहर शिक्षा का और ज्ञानदान का  बाजार भरा पड़ा होकर भी सर ने एक रुपया भी न लेते हुए हजारों विद्यार्थियों को पढ़ाया, न केवल पढ़ाये पर उनमें पढ़ने की रुचि भी जगाई। वाह सर ! मान गये आपको और आपके आदर्श को।" 
शरदराव की ओर देखकर जी. एम ने कहा। 
 " अरे सर! ये व्यक्ति तत्त्वनिष्ठ हैं। पैसों और मान सम्मान के भूखे भी नहीं हैं। विद्यार्थी का भला हो, यही एक मात्र उद्देश्य था। " चेयरमैन बोले। 
" मेरे पिताजी भी उन्हीं मे से एक हैं। एक समय भूखे रह लेंगे, पर अनाज में मिलावट करके बेचेंगे नहीं।" ये उनके तत्व थे। जिन्दगी भर उसका पालन किया। ईमानदारी से व्यापार किया। उसका फायदा आज मेरे भाईयों को हो रहा है।" 
बहुत देर तक कोई कुछ भी नहीं बोला  । फिर चेयरमैन ने शरदराव से पूछा, - "सर! आपने मकान बदल लिया या उसी मकान में रहते हैं। "
"उसी पुराने मकान में रहते हैं सर! "
शरदराव के बदले में राहुल ने ही उत्तर दिया। 
    उस उत्तर में पिताजी के प्रति छिपी नाराजगी तत्पर चेयरमैन साहब की समझ में आ गई । 
‌"तय रहा फिर। सर आज मैं आपको गुरु दक्षिणा दे रहा हूँ। इसी शहर में मैंने कुछ फ्लैट्स ले रखे हैं। उसमें से एक थ्री बी. एच. के. का मकान आपके नाम कर रहा हूँ....." 
 "क्या?" 
शरदराव और राहुल दोनों आश्चर्य चकित रूप से बोलें। "नहीं नहीं , इतनी बडी गुरु दक्षिणा नहीं चाहिये मुझे।" शरदराव आग्रहपूर्वक बोले। 
चेयरमैन साहब ने शरदराव के हाथ को अपने हाथ में लिया।  " सर, प्लीज....  ना मत करिये और मुझे माफ करें। काम की अधिकता में आपकी गुरु दक्षिणा देने में पहले ही बहुत देर हो चुकी है।" 
फिर राहूल की ओर देखते हुए उन्होंने पूछ लिया, राहुल!  तुम्हारी शादी हो गई क्या? "
‌" नहीं सर, जम गई है और जब तक रहने को अच्छा घर नहीं मिल जाता तब तक शादी नहीं हो सकती। ऐसी शर्त मेरे ससुरजी ने रखी होने से अभी तक शादी की डेट फिक्स नहीं की। तो फिर हाॅल भी बुक नहीं किया। " 
चेयरमैन ने फोन उठाया और किसी से बात करने लगे।समाधान कारक चेहरे से फोन रखकर, धीरे से बोले " अब चिंता की कोई बात नहीं। तुम्हारे मेरीज गार्डन का काम हो गया। *"सागर लान्स"* तो मालूम ही होगा! "
" सर वह तो बहुत महंगा है... "
" अरे तुझे कहाँ पैसे चुकाने हैं। सर के सारे विद्यार्थी सर के लिये कुछ भी कर सकते हैं। सर के बस एक आवाज देने की बात हैं। परन्तु सर तत्वनिष्ठ हैं, वैसा करेंगे भी नहीं। इस लान्स का मालिक भी सर का ही विद्यार्थी हैं। उसे मैंने सिर्फ बताया। सिर्फ हाॅल ही नहीं, भोजन सहित संपूर्ण शादी का खर्चा भी उठाने की जिम्मेदारियाँ ली हैं उसने... वह भी स्वखुशी से। तुम केवल तारीख बताओ और सामान लेकर जाओ। 
"बहूत बहूत धन्यवाद सर।" राहुल अत्यधिक खुशी से हाथ जोड़कर बोला। 
"धन्यवाद मुझे नहीं, तुम्हारे पिताश्री को दो राहुल! ये उनकी पुण्याई ह और मुझे एक वचन दो राहुल! सर के अंतिम सांस तक तुम उन्हें अलग नहीं करोगे और उन्हें 
कोई दुख भी नहीं होने दोगे। मुझे जब भी मालूम चला कि तुम उन्हें दुख दे रहे हो तो, न केवल इस कम्पनी से  लात मारकर भगा दूंगा परन्तु पूरे महाराष्ट्र भर के किसी भी स्थान पर नौकरी करने लायक नहीं छोडूंगा। ऐसी व्यवस्था कर दूंगा।"
चेयरमैन साहब कठोर शब्दों में बोले। 
" नहीं सर। मैं वचन देता हूँ, वैसा कुछ भी नहीं होगा। "राहुल हाथ जोड़कर बोला। 
   शाम को जब राहुल घर आया तब शरदराव किताब पढ रहे थे। पुष्पाबाई पास ही सब्जी काट रही थी। राहुल ने बैग रखी और शरदराव के पाँव पकड़कर बोला —" नाना, मुझसे गलती हो गई। मैं आपको आजतक गलत समझता रहा। मुझे पता नहीं था नाना, आप इतने बड़ा व्यक्तित्व लिये हो।" 
‌ शरदराव ने उसे उठाकर अपने सीने से लगा लिया।
अपना लड़का क्यों रो रहा हैं, पुष्पाबाई की समझ में नहीं आ रहा था। परन्तु कुछ अच्छा घटित हुआ है। इसलिये पिता-पुत्र में प्यार उमड़ रहा है। ये देखकर उनके नयनों से भी कुछ बून्दे गाल पर लुढ़क आई। 
.....................................
*एक विनती*
 *और कृपया अपने बड़ों से कभी यह न कहे कि "आपने मेरे लिये किया ही क्या है? क्या कमाकर रखा मेरे लिये? जो भी कमाना हो वो स्वयम् अर्जित करें। जो शिक्षा और संस्कार उन्होंने तुम्हें दिये हैं वही तुम्हें कमाने के लिए पथप्रदर्शक रहेंगे*🌹🌹🙏

2/16/20, 11:05 AM - Dean Sir: एक आदमी ने एक विज्ञापन दिया कि उसे उसकी चिन्ता करने वाला एक आदमी चाहिये। वेतन वो जो मांगेगा, मिलेगा।
विज्ञापन देखकर एक बेरोजगार तुरंत उसके पास गया और उसने उसके लिये चिन्ता करने वाली नौकरी के लिये 10000/ महीना सैलरी की मांग की। विज्ञापन देने वाले ने उसे 10000/ देना स्वीकार कर लिया और कहा कि तुम अभी से अपनी नौकरी शुरु कर सकते हो।

नौकरी शुरु हो गई। अब मालिक ने उसे अपनी सारी चिंताएं बता दी। 
मेरी महिने की आमदनी 50000है।
बच्चों की फिस 10000 महीना है।
मकान का भाडा 15000 महीना है।
घर का खाने पीने पर खर्च 15000 है।
मेरे रोज ऑफ़िस जाने का खर्च महिने भर का 5000 है।
धोबी का खर्च महिने का 3000 है।
काम वाली बाई को 2000 महीना देना होता है।
महिने मे एक बार हमलोग कहीं घुमने जाते हैं उसमे कम से कम 5000/ लग जाता है।
 अब चिन्ता करने वाला आदमी से बर्दाश्त नही हुआ, उसने कहा: मालिक आपका अभी तक का खर्च 55000 है और अभी आपने मेरा 10000सैलरी उसमे नही बताया है तो सब लेकर 65000हो गए, आमदनी आपकी 50000है, बाकी पैसा कहाँ से लाएंगे?
मालिक ने कहा उसी के लिये तो तुम्हे रखा है, अब तुम 10000ले रहे हो मेरी सारी चिन्ता करने के लिये तो मै क्यों चिन्ता करुँ, अब ये चिन्ता तुम करो कि बाकी पैसा कहाँ से आएगा।

2/16/20, 12:52 PM - +91 98185 06552: नाव का छेद 

एक आदमी ने एक पेंटर को बुलाया अपने घर, और अपनी नाव दिखाकर
 कहा कि इसको पेंट कर दो 

पेंटर ने पेंट ले कर उस नाव को पेंट कर दिया, लाल रंग से जैसा कि नाव का मालिक चाहता था।
फिर पेंटर ने अपने पैसे लिए और चला गया !

अगले दिन, पेंटर के घर पर वह नाव का मालिक पहुँच गया और उसने एक बहुत बड़ी धनराशि  का चेक दिया उस पेंटर को !

पेंटर भौंचक्का हो गया, और पूछा - ये किस बात के इतने पैसे हैं ? मेरे पैसे तो आपने कल ही दे दिये थे !

मालिक ने कहा - ये पेंट का पैसा नहीं है, बल्कि ये उस नाव में जो "छेद" था, उसको रिपेयर करने का पैसा है !

पेंटर ने कहा - अरे साहब, वो तो एक छोटा सा छेद था, सो मैंने बंद कर दिया था। उस छोटे से छेद के लिए इतना पैसा मुझे, ठीक नहीं लग रहा है !

मालिक ने कहा - दोस्त, तुम समझे नहीं मेरी बात !
अच्छा मैं विस्तार से समझाता हूँ। जब मैंने तुम्हें पेंट के लिए कहा तो जल्दबाजी में तुम्हें ये बताना भूल गया कि नाव में एक छेद है उसको रिपेयर कर देना !

 और जब पेंट सूख गया, तो मेरे दोनों बच्चे उस नाव को समुद्र में लेकर नौकायन के लिए  निकल गए !

मैं उस वक़्त घर पर नहीं था, लेकिन जब लौट कर आया और अपनी पत्नी से ये सुना कि बच्चे नाव को लेकर नौकायन पर निकल गए हैं !

 तो मैं बदहवास हो गया। क्योंकि मुझे याद आया कि नाव में तो छेद है !

मैं गिरता पड़ता भागा उस तरफ, जिधर मेरे प्यारे बच्चे गए थे। लेकिन थोड़ी दूर पर मुझे मेरे बच्चे दिख गए, जो सकुशल वापस आ रहे थे !

अब मेरी ख़ुशी और प्रसन्नता का आलम तुम समझ सकते हो !

फिर मैंने छेद चेक किया, तो पता चला कि, मुझे बिना बताये तुम उसको रिपेयर कर चुके हो !
उस महान कार्य के लिए तो ये पैसे भी बहुत थोड़े हैं !

मेरी औकात नहीं कि उस कार्य के बदले तुम्हे ठीक ठाक पैसे दे पाऊं !

आप भी ज़रूर ध्यान रखें कि जीवन मे "भलाई का कार्य" जब मौका लगे हमेशा कर देना चाहिए, भले ही वो बहुत छोटा सा कार्य ही क्यों न हो !

क्योंकि कभी कभी वो छोटा सा कार्य भी किसी के लिए बहुत अमूल्य हो सकता है।

उन सभी को जिन्होने 'हमारी जिन्दगी की नाव' कभी भी रिपेयर की है उन्हें हार्दिक धन्यवाद .....
आपका दिन और जीवन सदा मंगलमय रहे 
🙏 🙏🙏

As discussed with DR sir, bringing home-cooked food is purely left to the choice of our faculty members..they can decide what to bring and how much in quantity..there is no mention on all these which the individuals can decide better..
The whole thing was planned with the aim to add some excitement..so everyone is requested to be a part of this..
The food brought by facilities will be kept along the OTS of first floor on 7th..

3/4/20, 8:10 PM - Dean Sir: यूनिसेफ
 कोरोना वायरस 400-500 माइक्रो के सेल व्यास के आकार का होता है, इसलिए कोई भी मुखौटा/ मास्क इसके प्रवेश को रोकता है इसलिए फार्मासिट अपने व्यापार के लिए आपका शोषण कर सकतें हैं। 

 वायरस हवा में नहीं, बल्कि जमीन पर निवास करता है, इसलिए यह हवा द्वारा फैलता नहीं है।

 कोरोना वायरस, जब एक धातु की सतह पर गिरता है, तो 12 घंटे तक जीवित रहता है, इसलिए साबुन और पानी से अच्छी तरह से हाथ धोने से इससे बचा जा सकता है।

 कोरोना वायरस कपड़ों पर जब होता है तो 9 घंटे तक रहता है इसलिए कपड़े धोने के बाद, दो घंटे के लिए उन्हें सूरज की रोशनी में सुखाये जिससे इस वायरस को फैलने का मौका नही मिलता है।

 वायरस हाथों पर 10 मिनट तक रहता है इसलिए रोकथाम के उद्देश्य के लिए अल्कोहोल  सैनिटाइजर से हाथ धोये और इसे अपने साथ जेब में रखने का प्रयास करें। 

 यदि वायरस 26-27 डिग्री सेल्सियस के तापमान के संपर्क में है, तो यह स्वतः मर  जाएगा, यह गर्म क्षेत्रों में नहीं रहता है।  साथ ही गर्म पानी पीना और सूरज के संपर्क में रहना काफी अच्छा है।
 महत्वपूर्ण है आइसक्रीम से दूर रहें और ठंडे भोजन से दूर रहें। 

 गर्म पानी और नमक से गरारे करना टॉन्सिल को मारता है और फेफड़ों में रिसाव होने से रोकता है।

 इन निर्देशों का पालन करना वायरस को रोकने के लिए पर्याप्त है।

  Corona virus arrives in any country, sooner or later there is no doubt that many countries have no diagnostic sets or equipment, so
  Please use as much as possible of natural vitamin C to strengthen your immune system.
  Don't worry, C gets rid of it a lot, and it's fine.
  
    The virus currently contains no vaccine and no specific treatment
  Unfortunately, due to the genetic mutation that made it very dangerous
  This disease appears to be caused by gene fusion in a snake and bat, and it has acquired the ability to infect mammals, including humans.

It is important to keep the message on your greatest knowledge: Professor Chen Horin, CEO of the Beijing Military Hospital, said: "Slices of lemon in a cup of lukewarm water can save your life."  *
   Even if you work, you should take a look at this message and pass it on to others! The lemon cut into three parts and put in a cup, then pour hot water and turn it into (alkaline water), 
  After reading, talk to someone else and transfer it to the person you love and take care of your personal health.
  Council:
  Professor Chen Horin notes that anyone who receives this message is at least guaranteed to save someone's life...
  I have done my job and I hope you can help me develop it as well.

3/8/20, 12:08 PM - Swati Bhatt: Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.

I’m not cute or built to suit a fashion model’s size   

But when I start to tell them,

They think I’m telling lies.

I say,

It’s in the reach of my arms,
And the joy in my feet.   
The curl of my lips.   
It’s the fire in my eyes,   
And the flash of my teeth,   
The swing in my waist,   
It’s in the arch of my back,   
The sun of my smile,
The grace of my style.
It’s in the click of my heels,   
The bend of my hair,   
the palm of my hand,   
The need for my care.   
’Cause I’m a woman
Phenomenally.
Phenomenal woman,

That’s me.

By American Poet Dr Maya Angelou..

3/14/20, 9:51 PM - Manikandan SRM: 25 year old woman from Agra, got married to a techie from Bengaluru who works for Google in 1st week of February.

Left for honeymoon in 2nd week to Italy, from there to Greece and then to France.

Landed back at Mumbai on 27th Feb, from there took flight to Bengaluru.

On 7th March her husband tested positive, she was quarantined too, called her dad in Agra, dad said beta yeh hospital wale faaltu tang karenge tu ghar hi aaja, smart father.

Escaped from Hospital, on March 8th took flight from Bengaluru to Delhi, from Delhi took train for Agra.

Meanwhile police started searching for her in Bengaluru, found out she left for Agra, they contacted civil administration at Agra.

Agra health officers reached her house, the family shut the door on health officials resisted and didn't cooperate, 8 family members in total.

Health officials asked District Magistrate to help, he sent police to their home, taken to hospital, literally dragged out as they didn't wanted to take tests.

Woman tested positive now and the 7 positive cases of Agra are likely to be this family only.

Now imagine the person's she might have affected in flights, train and in Agra as she wasn't indoors all the time.

These are educated techies and most aware people in our society, such persons need to be charged for culpable homicide.

Idiots of the highest order.

If we take adequate precaution and break the chain then we can tide the Corona virus Outbreak else we have a big problem in hand especially for the elderly population
So far so good. India has done well so far in its fight to contain Corona Virus. Now we are in stage 3 in which Virus spreads through social contacts & in social gatherings. This is most critical stage & number of confirmed cases spread exponentially everyday like what happened in Italy between last week of February & second week of March. From 300 to 10,000. If India is not able to manage this stage for next 3 to 4 weeks then we could have confirmed cases not in Thousands but in Lakhs. This next one month is crucial. That is why most events & public gatherings have been closed till 15th April.

Just because schools are closed avoid getting that compulsive travel & Holiday bug. Holidays will come next year too why try your luck with Corona specially with children. Marriage functions, Birthday parties etc can wait. Don’t try your luck & that bravado that nothing will happen to me. Next 30 days will be most crucial in medical History of India. Take all precautions while at home & while outside for any important work. Precaution is not panic.

Be a responsible citizen by following & educating others to remain careful for next one month.

3/17/20, 10:42 PM - +91 99585 15757: Now here is an interesting conspiracy theory if you want:
Impact of coronavirus on stock exchanges worldwide, within 1 month: 

 🇺🇸 -26%
 🇬🇧 -26%
 🇨🇦 -25%
 🇧🇷 -27%
 🇷🇺 -20%
 🇦🇪 -19%
 🇿🇦 -16%
 🇦🇺 -24%
 🇮🇳 -14%
 🇸🇬 -17%
 🇭🇰 -12%
 🇰🇷 - 17%

Now, look at this: 

 🇨🇳 (China) + 0,3%

China, creator of the pandemic, has miraculously "recovered", has almost no more cases of coronavirus.  The world is now beginning to feel the effects and panic about the disease.  Who recovered first ??  China itself!  It seems to be that this virus was a move by the Chinese government in response to the loss of the trade war with the United States.  The goal: to throw the world into recession !!!
Is the scenario not clear?  They are already growing!  China bought almost everything it devalued on the stock exchanges around the world ... with that the Chinese became owners of the global companies that are in China and without the money leaving China.

Next 15-20 days
Corona Virus precautions for house-holds:

1. Wash milk bags the moment we take it & wash your hands while you are at it.

2. Consider cancelling newspapers.

3. Keep a separate tray for couriers. Courier person can place the envelope/pkg in the tray and courier may be left untouched for at least 24 hours. 

4. Instruct maids not to touch main door. On entering the home, she has to immediatly wash hands thoroughly, before touching other things . After that, wipe the calling-bell switch with a cleaning fluid :)

3. Avoid getting swiggy, amazon etc as far as possible.

4. Wash all fruits and vegitables once we bring them home.

5. Remote, phone and keyboards are the most highly contaminated elements in our house. Clean them at least once a day using cleaning fluid.

6. Wash hands frequently when in house or in office. Once every hour at least.

7. Avoid public transport as far as possible. Even Ola and Uber may be used when absolutely unavoidable.

8. Avoid gyms, swimming pool and other exercise areas, where surface contact or air-borne contamination is inevitable.

9. Cancel tuitions, dance/music classes, etc.

10. When you return home from office, shopping, etc. discard your clothes and wash your hands and feet thoroughly.

11. Most importantly do not touch hands anywhere on face. Inform children and parents.

12. Ask senior citizens to stop going for the routine walking exercise. 

Lets all be alert as we will enter stage 3 soon which is an outbreak of infection in community (from individual cases)

May be I am sounding a little over cautious but still wanted to share 🙏

Best explanation I have read about the corona virus: 
Feeling confused as to why Coronavirus is a bigger deal than Seasonal flu?
 Here it is in a nutshell. I hope this helps. Feel free to share this to others who don’t understand...
It has to do with RNA sequencing.... I.e. genetics.

Seasonal flu is an “all human virus”. The DNA/RNA chains that make up the virus are recognized by the human immune system. This means that your body has some immunity to it before it comes around each year... you get immunity two ways...through exposure to a virus, or by getting a flu shot.
Novel viruses, come from animals.... the WHO tracks novel viruses in animals, (sometimes for years watching for mutations). Usually these viruses only transfer from animal to animal (pigs in the case of H1N1) (birds in the case of the Spanish flu). But once, one of these animal viruses mutates, and starts to transfer from animals to humans... then it’s a problem, Why? Because we have no natural or acquired immunity.. the RNA sequencing of the genes inside the virus isn’t human, and the human immune system doesn’t recognize it so, we can’t fight it off.

Now.... sometimes, the mutation only allows transfer from animal to human, for years it’s only transmission is from an infected animal to a human before it finally mutates so that it can now transfer human to human... once that happens..we have a new contagion phase. And depending on the fashion of this new mutation, thats what decides how contagious, or how deadly it’s gonna be..
H1N1 was deadly....but it did not mutate in a way that was as deadly as the Spanish flu. It’s RNA was slower to mutate and it attacked its host differently, too.
Fast forward.
Now, here comes this Coronavirus... it existed in animals only, for nobody knows how long...but one day, at an animal market, in Wuhan China, in December 2019, it mutated and made the jump from animal to people. At first, only animals could give it to a person... But here is the scary part.... in just TWO WEEKS it mutated again and gained the ability to jump from human to human. Scientists call this quick ability, “slippery”
This Coronavirus, not being in any form a “human” virus (whereas we would all have some natural or acquired immunity). Took off like a rocket. And this was because, Humans have no known immunity...doctors have no known medicines for it.
And it just so happens that this particular mutated animal virus, changed itself in such a way the way that it causes great damage to human lungs..
That’s why Coronavirus is different from seasonal flu, or H1N1 or any other type of influenza.... this one is slippery AF. And it’s a lung eater...And, it’s already mutated AGAIN, so that we now have two strains to deal with, strain s, and strain L....which makes it twice as hard to develop a vaccine.
We really have no tools in our shed, with this. History has shown that fast and immediate closings of public places has helped in the past pandemics. Philadelphia and Baltimore were reluctant to close events in 1918 and they were the hardest hit in the US during the Spanish Flu.
Factoid: Henry VIII stayed in his room and allowed no one near him, till the Black Plague passed...(honestly...I understand him so much better now). Just like us, he had no tools in his shed, except social isolation...
And let me end by saying....right now it’s hitting older folks harder... but this genome is so slippery...if it mutates again (and it will). Who is to say, what it will do next.
Be smart folks... acting like you’re unafraid is so not sexy right now.
#flattenthecurve. Stay home folks... and share this to those that just are not catching on.
3/18/20, 7:47 PM - +91 74286 22961: Coronavirus, when it affects a person, comes out in the form of cold, dry cough, and fever. If an infected person’s saliva touches a surface, then that surface becomes a host for the virus. 

 Nature is the remedy to this man-made virus. The following herbs and concoctions can help you enhance your immunity and prevent Corona ..

1. Giloy ( Amruth ) - Gilly is the immunity-enhancer.
 It is commonly available in the market as a herb and tablet form.

2. Amla - the Indian Gooseberry.
Amla is an antioxidant and a rich source of Vitamin C, which is very important for boosting immunity. 

3. Tulsi - The queen of herbs.
 Tulsi herb is very effective in treating upper respiratory and lower respiratory diseases such as cough, cold, and dyspnea. 

4. Turmeric - The Golden Herb.
Turmeric help bolster the immune system by increasing the immunomodulating capacity of the body. Turmeric is anti-viral, anti-fungal and can help protect against cancer.

 
 PRANAYAMA - Regulation of Vital Energy.
During the practice of pranayama, we are literally drinking in gallons and gallons of vitality and immunity. Pranayama enhances and stimulates the immune system.

1. Kapalbhati -Breath of fire. This breathing exercise can remove 80% of the toxins in our body through the outgoing breath. 

2. Ujjayi pranayama - deep Ujjayi breathing help to stimulate the thymus gland but also induce a sense of calmness and relaxation that will help boost the immune system.

YOGASANA - 
Specific Yoga postures that will help stimulate the immune system are..

1.  The Tortoise pose ( Kurmasana) -  helps stimulate the thymus glands, Inversions. 

2. Downward Facing Dog ( Adha Mukha Svanasana)-  help to drain the sinuses.

 Chest & lung openers such as ..
3. Camel pose (Ustrasana) and
 4. Cobra Pose ( Bhujangasana) which also help to flush out the lungs .

 Restorative yoga poses such as 
5. Corpse Pose (Shavasana) and
 6.Shoulder Stand (Shasangasana) which help calm the nervous system down and strengthen the body’s immune response.

MANTRA JAP - The fourth chakra ( the place of thymus gland) sounds such as its mantra sound of “yum” or vowel sound of “ay” will improve the immune response. 

Start taking charge of your health today by doing a little yoga practice to help boost your immunity especially in these times of raging Coronavirus.

Be Healthy Be Happy

3/19/20, 9:01 AM - Prof Vinay Sharma: इन्क्यूबेशन पीरियड और कोरोना महामारी' की गम्भीरता को समझिए:
साहसी बनिए पर सिर्फ़ हम ही बुद्धिमान है ऐसा समझने की बेवकूफ़ी मत कीजिए ।
WHO, अमेरिका, यूरोप, प्रधानमन्त्री कार्यालय, IIM, IIT अन्य सभी को बेवकूफ़ मत समझिए जो स्कूल, कॉलेज, मॉल बन्द करवा रहे है ।
बहुत आवश्यक हो तो बाजार से सामान जरूर लें पर शर्ट या जूते एक महीने बाद भी खरीदे जा सकते है । रेस्टोरेंट एक महीने बाद भी जा सकते है ।
यह मैं इसलिए कह रहा हूँ क्योंकि कई जानकारों को ऐसा करते देखा है । यह बहादुरी नहीं मूर्खता है । ऐसे लोग अब भी गम्भीरता को नहीं समझ रहे है
लापरवाही से आप अपने साथ उन अनेक लोगों की जान लेने का प्रयास कर रहे है जो देश के लिए या अपने लिए जीना चाहते है ।

इन्क्यूबेशन पीरियड का खेल समझिए जिसे न समझने से इटली बर्बाद हुआ है ।

आप हम में से कोई भी कोरोना से इन्फेक्टेड हुआ तो ऐसा होते ही तुरन्त उसमें बीमारी के कोई लक्षण नहीं होंगे । उसे खुद भी मालूम नहीं होगा कि उसे कोई परेशानी है या वायरस का इन्फेक्शन हो गया है परन्तु उससे अन्य व्यक्ति में इन्फेक्शन ट्रांसमिट हो सकता है । वायरस से इन्फेक्ट होने से 14 दिन बाद तक कभी भी लक्षण आ सकते है ।
इसलिए आप और हम स्वस्थ लगने वाले व्यक्ति के साथ बैठे हो तब भी हो सकता है वह इन्क्यूबेशन पीरियड में हो ऐसे में हो सकता है हम कोई इन्फेक्शन अपने साथ ले आए और अपने परिवार के सदस्यों या अपने कलीग्स को दे आए । यह हमें भी पता तब चलेगा जब बीमारी के लक्षण दिखने लगेंगे ।
मैं किसी पैथी की बुराई नहीं कर रहा हूँ लेकिन कोई कितने ही दावे करे सच यह है कि COVID-19 का इलाज़ नहीं है । जो कह रहा है उसके पास इलाज़ है वह सफ़ेद झूठ बोल रहा है । जिस दिन बीमारी दिखेगी उस दिन उस व्यक्ति की रोग प्रतिरोधक क्षमता और वायरस की बीमार करने की क्षमता तथा उसके फेफड़ों, हार्ट, गुर्दे जैसे अंगों का सामर्थ्य तय करेगा कि वह ज़िन्दा बचेगा या नहीं ।
इसलिए यह दुस्साहस दिखाने वाले लोग अपने ही घर के वृद्ध लोगों के हत्यारे साबित होंगे जिनकी रोग प्रतिरोधक क्षमता कमजोर हो गई है ।
घबराने की आवश्यकता नहीं है पर अनावश्यक गोष्ठियां, घूमना, मिलना कुछ दिनों के लिए बन्द कीजिए । केवल ये दूरियां ही बचा सकती है मास्क, ग्लव्ज़, सैनिटाइजर कोई भी प्रोटेक्टिव नहीं है सिर्फ़ सहायक हो सकते है ।
अपनी नहीं भी करते हो पर अपनों की चिंता कीजिए । आपको जिन्होंने जीवन दिया है उन्हें मौत मत दीजिए ।
अभी भी वक़्त है सावधान हो जाइए ।
जो लोग इतनी कवायद कर रहे है उन सबको बेवकूफ़ मत समझिए वरना भारत में आंकड़ा किस कदर भी पार कर जाए तो भी आश्चर्य नहीं होगा ।
चीन और इटली के हालात देखने के बावजूद जो बड़ी ग़लती स्पेन ने की वो अब भारत में न दोहरायें। पिछले सप्ताह कोरोना मरीज़ों की संख्या देखते हुए सरकारी आदेश से स्पेन के स्कूल कॉलेज बंद करवा दिये गये तो कई बच्चे और उनके माता पिता, दादा दादी नाना नानी आदि पार्क में पिकनिक करने लगे। इसका नतीजा यह हुआ कि अचानक से मरीज़ों की संख्या बढ़ने लगी। तब सख़्ती से और दंड से लोगों को समझाया गया कि यह छुट्टियों का समय नहीं बल्कि आपातकाल है। सख़्ती से घर पर रहने के आदेश दिये गये। किंतु इस बीच इनफ़ेक्शन कहाँ तक और कितना फैल गया, फ़िलहाल इसका अंदाज़ा नहीं है। आगे आने वाले दो सप्ताह में इसका पता लग ही जायेगा।

भारत के निवासियों से निवेदन है, इन बड़ी बड़ी ग़लतियों से सबक़ लें, अभी से जागरूक हो जायें और कोशिश करें कि अधिक लोगों से न मिलें। जहाँ भी भीड़ की संभावना हो, यदि अत्यंत आवश्यक न हो तो वहाँ न जायें। कुछ दिन घर में रहें तो सभी सुरक्षित रहेंगे। अपने कॉमन सेंस का प्रयोग करें कि यदि बाहर जाने की वाक़ई ज़रूरत न हो तो परिवार सहित घर में ही बने रहें। ज़रूरी होने पर मास्क अवश्य लगायें। साबुन से बार बार हाथ धोयें । कोई भी पारिवारिक या सामाजिक उत्सव कुछ समय के लिये स्थगित कर दें। आप जितने कम लोगों से मिलेंगे, आप और आपके अपने उतने ही सुरक्षित रहेंगे। याद रखिये कि समझदारी से उठाया गया आपका प्रत्येक क़दम इस महामारी से लड़ने में अत्यंत प्रभावशाली तौर से सहायक हो सकता है। भीड़ से बचें, जागरूकता के साथ सुरक्षित रहें, स्वस्थ रहें।

Dear All

*Most serious alert to all of us* 

It is our individual responsibilities to protect ourself and our family, surroundings

Even after government/organization/industries taking safety measures as work from home, controlling crowds, holidays , *shutdown many activities to isolate people at home* but still people are travelling around the country.
*Job related and important travel can't be avoided*

Also people admitted in hospital for COVID19 check are trying to escape hospitals *due to lack of facilities in hospital*

*NOTE*: Only two cities in Italy were in COVID19 alert initially and when the government taken decision to isolate, people from those cities travelled to their home town around the country.. this is how situation became worst in Italy from starting stage.... *the same is happening right now in our country also*

*Though we can't be united physically closer We can be united mentally and everyone together can win this disaster* 💪

Humanity, self awareness, keep surroundings clean and by following all safety measures instructed by W.H.O. we can protect our family...  Please be cautious and let us fix our future

Everyone, especially 
Senior citizens to stay home

+ Janta curfew on this Sunday 22/03/2020 as a practice/drill 7am-9pm
No going out of home during this time. Spread this msg as much as possible. each person tell 10 other people everyday for next 2 days. 

+ Expressing thankfulness to service providers - medical, home delivery, media etc, at 5pm on Sunday 22/3/2020 by standing outside your home /balcony and clapping or ringing bells/ plates to salute and encourage them.

+Speak to doc on phone if anything, avoid using medical resources 

+ Take economic interest of those who work for you as this situation will worsen the financial situation of many, e.g. don't cut wages, decide humanely/sensitively. 

+ Supply of milk, food, medicine will not be stopped therefore pls do not hoard. Buy as you normally buy, do not do panic buying.

+ Put all energy in stopping corona. And fight against this global pandemic
Save yourse, save the country, save the world

3/20/20, 9:28 AM - +91 99999 90901: *THE LOGIC  BEHIND JANTA CURFEW* .
As carona virus life at one place is 12 hrs and Janta curfew is for 14 hrs so the places  or points of public areas where  carona may have survived will not be touched for 14 hrs and this will break the chain . 
What we get  after 14 hrs will be a safer country.
That is the idea behind . Next this will be a drill if needed longer in near future ...👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
 Lets all observe 'Janta Curfew' on Sunday, 22nd March 2020. Lets pledge not to move out of our houses on Sunday and take the first step to fight back Covid-19. I pledge to fight back Covid-19.
STAY AT HOME ,STAY SAFE..

3/20/20, 2:34 PM - Vikas Vidhyarthy Civil: Corona- the teacher reminds us of our Indian traditions and age-old practices

*1. Why the bathrooms and toilets were *outside* our houses and not *inside*

*2. Why we should not touch anything or anybody when we return from a barbershop or a funeral. You may return to normalcy *only* after having a bath immediately.*

*3. Why the footwear has to be kept outside the house and not inside.*

*4. Why we have to wash our hands and feet when we returned from schools or outside after playing.*

*5. Why a mandatory 10 days isolation / quarantine (especially at a birth or death) in traditional households.*

*6. Why the households must not cook if there's a dead body inside the house.*
 
*7. Why the washing of discarded clothes has to be done outside the house and not inside.*

*8. Why was it mandatory to be clean and have bath before cooking for the house.*

*9. Why once you have had bath, you were not supposed to physically touch those who did not.*

Maintaining physical hygiene, social distance and cleanliness were laughed at, ridiculed, insulted, systematically breaking these traditions brick by brick, forcing people to discard these rituals for the fear of being isolated and *force fit* into a society blindly aping the Western way of life. 

Now, all these habits &  routines followed by our forefathers from time immemorial stand validated.👍

3/20/20, 4:02 PM - Ranjana Mam: एक दिन के कर्फ्यू का महत्त्व।
कॅरोना वायरस किसी सतह पर लगभग 9 से 12 घंटे  जीवित रहता है।
ओर कर्फ्यू का समय सुबह 7 से रात 9 बजे तक।  मतलब 14 घंटे।
ओर फिर रात मतलब मोटे तौर पे 24 घंटे अर्थात ये 24 घंटे लोग घरों में रहेंगे तो वायरस कांटेक्ट खत्म हो जाएगा और सोशल ट्रांसमिशन का खतरा बहुत कम हो जाएगा।
बहुत बुद्धिमानी का निर्णय।
हम सबको मिलकर ऐसे 100%बनाना चाहिए। ये एक माइलस्टोन साबित होगा।

Bhagat Singh, Shivaram Rajguru and Sukhdev Thapar were inspirational youngsters, and their sacrifice remained etched in the Indian conscience.  Amongst them, Bhagat Singh stood out for his bravery, clarity of thought and exceptional patriotism. On this day, we look back at Bhagat's thoughts on revolution, freedom, love and individuality.

3/23/20, 10:38 PM - Vikas Vidhyarthy Civil: This is how we fight together. (from the  news paper of 23th March)

1.  After, the notification by GoI to cap the retail prices Mask at ₹10 and hand sanitizer at ₹100 per 200 ml, leading FMCG companies such as HUL, Reckitt Benckiser, ITC, Godrej and Dabur has slashed their prices of sanitizer by upto 70%. 

2.  Leading liquor Companies like Amrut Distilleries and John Distilleries has approached the GoI license to manufacturer sanitizers. (Ethyl alcohol is a key ingredient of both liquor and sanitizer.)

3. Many technical institutes (including IITs, NITs, IACS, Pharmaceutical Science colleges) in India are already making their own senitizer.

4. Mahindra and Mahindra  has  started manufacturing ventilators in his car manufacturing factories. Internationally, Volkswagen, GM, Ford, and Tesla are already doing this.

5. The GoI, Telecommunication Companies and video streaming companies (like youtube, amazon, hotstar) are talking together and planning to temporarily migrate from HD to SD streaming. So that the load on the internet bandwidth can be reduced.

6. GoI has asked and provided funds to state governments to purchase medical equipments as per need. In addition to that he GoI has also purchased 1200 ventilators (as of 22 March) as a buffer stock in case of emergency requirement by any of the state government.

7. Mahindra Holidays will also offer its resorts as temporary care facility and hospital.

8.  The Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) is assisting the Pharmaceutical Companies in finding a cure of CoViD-19.  The DGCI has offered 7 measures for speeding up the process from giving Fast Track approval for repurposed drug to waving animal Street and offering flexible pathway which earlier would have taken months.

9. According to the minuts of meeting held by Textile Ministry, supply order was placed for 1 million 3-ply masks. Moreover, the HLL lifecare -- the government's nodal agency for the procuring Personal Protective Equipments has floated a tender for 725000 body covers, 1.5 million N-95 masks and 1 million 3-ply masks.

10. The government has asked Defence and Atomic Research labs to join the national effort to find a solution to deal with the Covid-19 virus outbreak. The country's biotechnology, science, and technology research institutions have also been tasked to source clinical samples from any government approved clinical testing sites and do research on the virus. The decision was taken by the empowered committee for OPD 19 response led by Dr Vinod Paul member of Niti Aayog and K vijayraghavan principal scientific advisor to the government. The Pune-based National Institute of virology has already sequenced the genome of the virus -- India being 5th country to do so --  which is essential to do research on finding test drugs and vaccines.

11. The labour ministry is working on comprehensive package to provide relief to workers and employers in the organised sector, as the the covide-19 outbreak shuts factories and offices takes a toll on jobs and impact livelihoods. An announcement could be made as early as this week.

3/24/20, 9:36 AM - DR Sir WhatsApp No: Novel Covid-19 (Coronavirus) conspiracy theory:

Worth pondering! 

How come Russia & North Korea are totally free of Covid- 19? Because they are staunch ally of China. Not a single case reported from this 2 countries. On the other hand South Korea / United Kingdom / Italy / Spain and Asia are severely hit. How come Wuhan is suddenly free from the deadly virus? China will say that their drastic  initial  measures they took was very stern and Wuhan was locked down to contain the spread to other areas. Why Beijing was not hit?  Why only Wuhan? Kind of interesting to ponder upon.. right? Well ..Wuhan is open for business now. America and all the above mentioned countries are devastated financially. Soon American economy will collapse as planned by China.  China knows it CANNOT defeat America militarily as USA is at present THE MOST POWERFUL  country in the world. So use the virus...to cripple the economy and paralyse the nation and its Defense capabilities. I'm sure Nancy Pelosi got a part in this. . to topple Trump. Lately President Trump was always telling of how GREAT American economy was  improving in all fronts. The only way to destroy his vision of making AMERICA GREAT AGAIN is to create an economic havoc. Nancy Pelosi was unable to bring down Trump thru impeachment. ....so work along with China to destroy Trump by releasing a virus. Wuhan,s epidemic was  a showcase. At the peak of  the virus epidemic. ..China's President Xi Jinping...just wore a simple RM1 facemask to visit those effected areas.  As President he should be covered from head to toe.....but it was not the case.  He was already injected to resist any harm from the virus....that means a cure was  already in place before the virus was released. Some may ask....Bill Gates already predicted the outbreak in 2015...so the chinese agenda cannot be true. The answer is. ..YES...Bill Gates did predict. .but that prediction is based on a genuine virus outbreak.  Now China is also telling that the virus was predicted well in advance. ....so that its agenda would play along well to match that  prediction. China,s vision is to control the World economy by buying up stocks now from countries facing the brink of severe  ECONOMIC COLLAPSE.  Later China will announce that  their Medical Researchers  have found a cure to destroy the virus.  Now China have other countries stocks in their arsenal and these countries will soon be slave to their master...CHINA.Now here is an interesting conspiracy theory if you want:

China, creator of the pandemic, has miraculously "recovered", has almost no more cases of coronavirus.  The world is now beginning to feel the effects and panic about the disease.  Who recovered first ??  China itself!  It seems to be that this virus was a move by the Chinese government in response to the loss of the trade war with the United States.  The goal: to throw the world into recession !!!

Is the scenario not clear?  They are already growing!  China bought almost everything it devalued on the stock exchanges around the world ... with that the Chinese became owners of the global companies that are in China and without the money leaving China.

While everyone is scared of Corona virus,forced to take preventive measures,many are sitting at home,isolated at home,working from home,spending maximum hours watching news from all over the world, Doctors are giving their divine help & services for which we are saluting them!🙏

There is one more profession,which mostly remain very subtle and are not much spoken about but they too give their 100% always during any crisis.They never shut down.They are the Engineers.. Just imagine,if there is no network, and you are unable to connect yourself with your phones,laptops,internet etc just for an hour, how the life will be in such critical situations?As internet & Mobile phones are todays most important needs,of every human being.To know about your loved ones,(near/distant) to work from your home, to buy important medicines & other things, U need Network! 📱📲📳
When most of the companies have declared work from home, Our technical/non technical team are working constantly that too from the office, sites etc.Their families are scared, in these circumstances but they can't sit at home! It's only because of their efforts, YOU, ME & ALL can share,post & circulate messeges, Smile, talk to our friends and family, know about the world...They haven't isolated themselves for us....They bring the world to us..

👏👏👏🙏
Proud of Telecom Guys !

Important advisory: NDMA has issued an order directing all Ministries/Depts and States/UTs to take effective measures to check spread of #COVID2019 in the country. The order will remain in force for 21 days.Detailed 6 pages of guidelines have been enclosed with the advisory 1/n https://t.co/DvoDFd67rP https://twitter.com/PIB_India/status/1242480775234125829?s=20
3/24/20, 10:03 PM - Pankaj Varshne: I can not hold myself to share this among you all. As Currently lockdown and curfew imposed at many places. But you need to go out for daily essentials. Kindly follow these ONEs.

ONE person: Identify one adult in a family for going out. Only he or she will go out. NOBODY ELSE.

ONE dress: Use only one dress and same dress every time you go out. Use full length dress. Don't mix this dress with your other dresses. 

ONE wallet: Use only one wallet. Don't mix these currency, coins and cards with other which already are there at home.

ONE shopping bag: Use only one and same shopping bag every time. 

ONE vehicle: Use same vehicle and key. Avoid public transportation.

ONE go: Avoid going out multiple times. Finish all your work in one go.

Avoid taking mobile phone or restrict using it.

Avoid crowding and come back immediately once you finish your work.

Use your non dominant hand or elbow to open the door or push the buttons. 

Once you come back: Keep your dress, wallet, bags, keys in a separate bag. Don't mix with others. Do thorough hand wash and face wash before touching anything and anyone. Clean your mobile phone surface with sanitizer. Best is to avoid mobile phone. 

Remember, we CAN'T AVOID exposure but we CAN REDUCE exposure.🙏

फिर चलना तु अपनी मजिलं के लिए। अरे मजिलं तो फिर भी मिल जायेगी,

ये जीवन का फूल गर टूट गया, 
तो दोबारा नहीं खिलेगा ये।।

As of tomorrow, do not leave home for bread for anything, because the worst begins, the incubation date is met and many positives will start to come out and many people can get it, so it is very important to stay home and not relate to  nobody, being very careful is very important and very crucial

 From March 23 to April 3 we must take care of ourselves as we will be
 at the peak of the virus is two weeks, normally in those two weeks all infected will appear then there are two weeks of calm and then two weeks where it decreases.

 What happened in Italy is that they were neglected in the contagion season and that is why all the cases turned out together.

 And finally, do not receive visits from anyone, not even from the same family.  This is all for the good of all.

*_WE WILL BE IN THE MAXIMUM STAGE OF INFECTION._*

Majority of people are fasting as it is Navratri and always give gifts and money to Kanjaks on Ashtmi and Navami. This year we have no option so depending on the number of kanjaks we give gift to, all of us can donate the same amount in Pradhan Mantri fund, either through paytm or NEFT(Govt. can issue the number). I give it to 11 girls and everyone gives minimum Rs. 11, thus making it 11x11=Rs. 121. If one person will give Rs. 121 then even if only 2 crore people(out of 130 crores) donate, it will make Rs. 242,00,00,000.(Rs. Two Hundred Forty Two Crores) for Corona Victims/Poor people. 

No load on a single person but together we can bring a huge difference

3/28/20, 10:41 PM - Vikas Vidhyarthy Civil: चीन ने धोखा देकर आर्थिक विश्व विजय हासिल कर ली है।

उसने सबसे पहले कोरोना वायरस की वैक्सीन बनाई और तब तक अपने फ्रिजों में रखी जब तक पूरे विश्व की आर्थिक अर्थव्यवस्था को पाताल में नहीँ उतार दिया। चीन पूरी दुनिया के इन्वेस्टर्स का हब बन गया था। 
चीन ने अपने वुहान शहर में इस वायरस को छोडा और जबरदस्त मौतों के कारण भागते इन्वेस्टर्स के शेयरों को कौडी के भाव खरीद  लिये और  विदेशी निवेशक और उद्यमी अपनी पूंजी छोड़ कर भाग गये चीन ने अपने द्वारा पहले से बनाई और छुपा कर रखी गई वैक्सीन को बाहर निकाल लिया और एक ही दिन में चीन हो रही मौतों को रोक दिया। इस युद्ध में चीन ने अपने कुछ लोग खोये पर पूरी दुनिया की दौलत लूट ली।आज वहाँ एक भी मौत नहीँ हुइ और न ही एक भी मरीज की संख्या बढी ।आज ये वायरस पूरी दुनिया में काल की तरह चक्कर लगा रहा है।
कमाल ये भी देखिये उन सभी देशों और शहरों की कमर टूट गई है जहाँ पर चीनी 
नागरिक खर्च करते थे। आज पूरा विश्व 
हर रोज अपनी अर्थव्यवस्था को ध्वस्त होते देख रहा है। पर 17 मार्च सै चीन की अर्थव्यवस्था दिनों दिन मजबूत हो रही है। 
ये एक आर्थिक युद्ध है जिसमें चीन जीत चुका है और विश्व कुदरत से युद्ध करते करते रोज अपने जान माल को गंवा रहा है। 
ये भारत के लोगों का इम्यून है कि वह हर संकट में कुशल यौद्धा की तरह लडता है और जीतता है।हमारे देश के अधिकांश नागरिक इकनोमी के आकंडो में नहीँ फसते, पत्थर में से 
पानी निकालने की कुव्वत रखते हैं। हम भारतीय बडे से बडे 
रोग को रोटी के टुकड़े में लपेट कर खाने और पचाने में 
माहिर हैं। हम कभी कुदरत के विरुद्ध  युद्ध नहीँ करते बल्कि उसकी पूजा करते हैं। हम भारतीय मन्दिरों ,गुरुद्वारों से आवाज दे दे कर बुलाते हैं ईश्वर को 
रिझाते हैं अतः वो ईश्वर हमारा अनिष्ट कर ही नहीँ सकता।
पर हर भारतीय को
याद रखना चाहिए कि चीन और चीनी इस कुदरत के खल नायक है इनसे हर प्रकार की दूरी बनाए 
रखें।
वुहान से शंघाई = 839 km
वुहान से बीजिंग = 1152 km
वुहान से मिलान = 15000 km
वुहान से न्यूयॉर्क = 15000 km

पास के बीजिंग/ शंघाई में कोरोना का कोई प्रभाव नहीं 
लेकिन इटली, ईरान, यूरोप देशों में लोगों की मृत्यु और पूरे विश्व की अर्थव्यवस्था बर्बाद.

चीन के सभी व्यापारिक क्षेत्र सुरक्षित

कुछ तो गड़बड़ है,
अमेरिका ऐसे ही नहीं चीन को दोष दे रहा.

 चीन से 10 कड़े सवाल : (सवाल नं 6,7,8,9 अवश्य पढ़ें)

1) जहां पूरी दुनिया इससे प्रभावित हो रही है, वहीं चीन में वुहान के अलावा यह क्यों कहीं नहीं फैला? चीन की राजधानी आखिर इससे अछूती कैसे रह गयी? 

2) प्रारंभिक अवस्था में चीन ने पूरी दुनिया से इस वायरस के बारे में क्यों छुपाया?

3)  कोरोना के प्रारंभिक सैंपल को नष्ट क्यों किया?

4) इसे सामने लाने वाले डॉक्टर और पत्रकार को खामोश क्यों किया? पत्रकार को तो गायब ही कर दिया गया है?

5)  दुनिया के अन्य देशों ने जब सूचना साझा करने को कहा तो उसने सूचना साझा क्यों नहीं किया? मना क्यों किया? 

6) कोरोना मानव से मानव में फैलता है, इसे छुपाने के लिए WHO  के कम्युनिस्ट निदेशक का उपयोग क्यों किया गया? WHO के निदेशक जनवरी में "बीझिंग (चीन)" में क्या कर रहे थे ..... ?????? (प्लान फिक्सिंग कर रहे थे क्या?)

7) "किसी भी अंतरराष्ट्रीय उड़ान के लिए कोई गाइडलाइन जारी करने की जरूरत नहीं है, क्योंकि यह मानव से मानव में नहीं फैलता है" ....ऐसा ट्वीट 11 जनवरी तक WHO करता रहा । क्यों ???  आज साबित हो गया कि कोरोना मानव से मानव में फैलता है... तो फिर WHO ने झूठ क्यों बोला ????

8) वुहान से एकसाथ 50,00,000 लोगों को बिना मेडिकल जांच किए "दुनिया के अलग-अलग हिस्से में" क्यों भेजा गया ..???  

9) इटली में 6 फरवरी तक मामूली केस था। एकाएक चीनी 'हम चीनी हैं वायरस नहीं, हमें गले लगाइए।' प्लेकार्ड के साथ दुनिया के पर्यटन स्थल 'सिटी ऑफ लव' के नाम से मशहूर इटली के लोगों को गले लगाने क्यों पहुंचे ???

10) पूरी दुनिया  आज चीन और WHO को संदेह की नजर से देख रही है और ताज्जुब देखिए कि एक ही दिन चीन और WHO, दोनों भारत की तारीफ में उतर आए! क्या यह महज संयोग है? 

11)  और इसके अगले ही दिन भारत में चीन के राजदूत ट्वीट कर उम्मीद करते हैं कि भारत इंटरनेशनल कम्युनिटी में उसकी पैरवी करे। आखिर क्यों? नेहरू की एक गलती का खामियाजा हम भुगत चुके हैं। यह मोदी सरकार है, और उम्मीद है वह कम से कम वह गलती तो नहीं ही दोहराएगी? 

12) सार्क से लेकर G-20 तक की बैठक पीएम मोदी के कहने पर हो रही है‌। संकट के समय भारत वर्ल्ड लीडर के रूप में उभरा है। इटली, जर्मनी, स्पेन, फ्रांस, ब्रिटेन, अमेरिका तक जब कैरोना से निबटने में असफल हो रहे हैं तो पीएम मोदी की पहल पर भारत इससे कहीं बेहतर तरीके से डील कर रहा है। 

चीन इसी का फायदा उठाकर यह चाहता है कि भारत इंटरनेशनल कम्युनिटी में उसके अछूतपन को दूर करे। अब यह नहीं होगा।  चीन संदेह के घेरे में है और रहेगा!

 दुनिया पर हावी होने का तरीका ??

 चीनी रणनीति:-

 1. सबसे पहले एक वायरस और उसकी दवा बनाई।

 2. फिर वायरस फैलाया।

 3. अपनी दक्षता का प्रदर्शन करते हुए रातों- रात अस्पतालों का निर्माण करवा लिया (आखिरकार वे पहले से ही तैयार थे) परियोजनाओं के साथ साथ उपकरण का आदेश देना, श्रम, पानी और सीवेज नेटवर्क को किराए पर लेना, पूर्वनिर्मित निर्माण सामग्री और एक प्रभावशाली मात्रा में स्टॉक.. यह सब उस रणनीति का हिस्सा थे।

 4. परिणामस्वरूप दुनिया में वायरस के साथ साथ अराजकता फैलने लगी, खास कर के यूरोप में।

 5. दर्जनों देशों की अर्थव्यवस्था त्वरित रूप से प्रभावित हुई।

 6. अन्य देशों के कारखानों में उत्पादन लाइनें बंद हो गई।

 7. फलस्वरूप शेयर बाजार में ज़बरदस्त गिरावट।

 8. चीन ने अपने देश में महामारी को जल्दी से नियंत्रित कर लिया। रातों रात वुहान से कोरोना के नए मरीज मिलना बन्द ही हो गए। यह कैसे सम्भव है जबकि इटली जैसा देश इस स्थिति को नहीं सम्भाल पर रहा है। आखिरकार, चीन पहले से ही तैयार था।

 9. परिणाम स्वरूप उन वस्तुओं की कीमत कम हो गई, जिनसे वह बड़े पैमाने पर तेल आदि खरीदता हैं।

 10. फिर चीन तुरन्त ही उत्पादन करने के लिए वापस जुट गया, जबकि दुनिया एक ठहराव पर है। जहां एक ओर दुनिया में हाहाकार मचा हुआ है, वहीं चीन ने अपनी फैक्ट्रियों में काम शुरू करवा दिया है? चीन उन चीजों को खरीदने लगा जिनकी कीमत में भारी गिरावट हो गई थी और उनको बेचने लगा जिनकी कीमत में ज़बरदस्त इजाफा हुआ है।


अब यदि विश्वास ना हो रहा हो तो...
1999 में, चीनी उपनिवेशों किआओ लियांग और वांग जियांगसुई के द्वारा लिखी गई पुस्तक, "अप्रतिबंधित युद्ध: अमेरिका को नष्ट करने के लिए चीन का मास्टर प्लान" को पढ़ लें!!* ये सब तथ्य वहाँ मौजूद है।

 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
 
ज़रा इस बारे में सोचिए...

 कैसे रूस और उत्तर कोरिया कोविड 19 याने कोरोना से पूरी तरह से मुक्त हैं? क्योंकि वे चीन के कट्टर सहयोगी हैं।  इन 2 देशों से एक भी मामले की सूचना नहीं मिली।  दूसरी ओर दक्षिण कोरिया / यूनाइटेड किंगडम / इटली / स्पेन और एशिया गंभीर रूप से प्रभावित हैं। क्योंकि ये सब चीन के प्रतिस्पर्धी है..
 
कैसे हुआ वुहान अचानक घातक वायरस से मुक्त?

चीन यह कहेगा कि उनके प्रारंभिक उपाय बहुत कठोर थे और वुहान को अन्य क्षेत्रों में फैलाने के लिए बंद याने लोकडाउन कर दिया गया था। परन्तु ये जवाब बड़ा ही  मजाकिया है..ऐसा होता तो बाकी के देशों में भी यह इतना नहीं फैलता और एक शहर तक ही सीमित रहता। यह 100% सत्य है कि वे वायरस के एंटी डोड का उपयोग कर रहे हैं।

 बीजिंग में कोई क्यों नहीं मारा गया? केवल वुहान ही क्यों?  दिलचस्प विचार है ये ...खैर, वुहान अब व्यापार के लिए खुल गया है। अमेरिका और उपर्युक्त सभी देश आर्थिक रूप से तबाह हैं।  जल्द ही अमेरिकी अर्थव्यवस्था चीन की योजना के अनुसार ढह जाएगी।  चीन जानता है कि वह अमेरिका को सैन्य रूप से नहीं हरा सकता क्योंकि वर्तमान में इस हिसाब से अमरीका विश्व में सबसे बड़ा ताकतवर देश है।

तो यह है चीन का विश्व विजय फार्मूला...वायरस का उपयोग करें दूसरे देशों की अर्थव्यवस्था और रक्षा क्षमताओं को पंगु बनाने के लिए। निश्चित ही नैन्सी पेलोसी को इसमें एक सहायक बनाया गया था कारण था ट्रम्प को टक्कर देने के लिए। राष्ट्रपति ट्रम्प हमेशा यह बताते रहे है कि कैसे ग्रेट अमेरिकन अर्थव्यवस्था सभी मोर्चों में सुधार कर रही है।  AMERICA GREAT AGAIN बनाने की उनकी दृष्टि को नष्ट करने का एकमात्र तरीका आर्थिक तबाही था।  नैन्सी पेलोसी ट्रम्प के खिलाफ महाभियोग लाने में असमर्थ थी।  .... इसलिए चीन के साथ मिलकर एक वायरस जारी करके ट्रम्प को नष्ट करने का यह तरीका उन्होंने अपनाया। वुहान तो महामारी का सिर्फ एक प्रदर्शन था...अब ये वायरस महामारी को चरम पर ले जा चुका है!!!

चीन के राष्ट्रपति शी जिनपिंग उन प्रभावी क्षेत्रों का दौरा करने के लिए बस एक साधारण RM1 फेसमास्क पहन कर पहुंचे थे राष्ट्रपति के रूप में उन्हें सिर से पैर तक ढंका जाना चाहिए ..... लेकिन ऐसा नहीं था।  वायरस से किसी भी तरह के नुकसान का विरोध करने के लिए उन्हें पहले ही इंजेक्शन लगाया गया था। इसका मतलब है कि वायरस के निकलने से पहले ही उसका इलाज चल रहा था।

अब यदि आप तर्क दें कि - बिल गेट्स ने पहले ही 2015 में एक वायरस फैलने की भविष्यवाणी कर दी थी ... इसलिए चीनी एजेंडा सच नहीं हो सकता।  तो उत्तर है- हाँ, बिल गेट्स ने भविष्यवाणी की थी लेकिन वह भविष्यवाणी एक वास्तविक वायरस के प्रकोप पर आधारित थी ना की मानव जनित। अब चीन यह भी बता रहा है कि वायरस का पहले से ही अनुमान था ताकि इसका एजेंडा उस भविष्यवाणी से मेल खा सके और सब कुछ प्राकृतिक या स्वतः प्रकिया लगे। अभी भी यदि यह प्रमाणिक तथ्य आपको बनावटी लगता है तो आगे स्वयं देखियेगा... चीन का अगला कदम गिरती हुई आर्थिक अर्थव्यवस्था के कगार का सामना करने वाले देशों से अब स्टॉक खरीद कर विश्व अर्थव्यवस्था को अपने नियंत्रण में करना होगा...  बाद में चीन यह घोषणा करेगा कि उनके मेडिकल शोधकर्ताओं ने वायरस को नष्ट करने का इलाज ढूंढ लिया है।
अब चीन के पास अपनी सेनाओं के शस्त्रागारों में अन्य देशों के स्टॉक हैं और ये देश जल्द ही मजबूरी में अपने मालिक के गुलाम होंगे !!

और हां, एक बात और...
जिस चीनी डॉक्टर ने इस वायरस का खुलासा किया था, वह भी चीनी अधिकारियों द्वारा हमेशा के लिए खामोश कर दिया गया....
विचारणीय

3/29/20, 6:06 PM - Anna Alphy: Ist hand information
Dear friends
Our Doctor who recovered from Corona illness and recovered in double quick time had inhaled Steam.
The doctors at IDH Corona centre too are continually inhaling steam.

Steaming raises the temperature of lungs, throat and mouth so that if the virus is already there it gets inactivate due to high temperature.

Yes that’s true as viruses sit in the throat first. 

That’s why even if there is someone sneezing in your office and you come home and inhale and gargle with warm water and salt, usually you will not get the flu. 

I recommend for everyone who is able to do it - 
1. Use steam inhalation everyday - morning and evening if possible,
2. Gargle with warm water and salt daily - morning and evening if possible.

This is a good daily practice which will improve your overall well-being and can be continued even after COVID19 ends.

Please also pass this information for the benefit of others.

3/30/20, 7:52 AM - +91 74286 22961: *Know yourself with Durga(The goddess of Strength)*
When she decides to reach her goal, she reaches it. She is a winner. 

》DURGA represents the ideal female or the Mother of the the Universe. She is called in Sanskrit JAGAT JANANI.

Durga is also reffered as “Triyambake,” the three eyed Goddess. The left eye represents the Moon (Desire); the right eye represents the Sun (action): and the central eye fire (knowledge). Lord Shiva, her spouse also possesses three eyes. we all have knowledge. Know your knowledge through Yoga.

The woman sitting on the tiger signifies the calming of the Male Ego, (the roaring Tiger). It is common knowledge that when the man is angry, he can become a predator like the tiger, he can potentially destroy the woman. The duty of the woman at that point is to calm his ego down and make the tiger qualities in him die, resulting in a DEAD tiger skin.

》We all are connected to God.The CONCH SHELL symbolizes the “Pranava” or “Om”, which indicates her connection to God in the form of sound.

The TRISHUL represents Mother’s ability to remove the three types of misery – physical, mental and spiritual. A mother’s touch is very comforting. A wife has the ability to soothe her family whenever faced with challenges. She controls all three worlds – HEAVEN, HELL, and EARTH.

Durga is depicted with eight or ten arms. This is a representation of the eight qundrants or ten directions in Hinduism which indicates her protection from all directions to devotees.

The SUDARSHAN CHAKRA or the Circular WHEEL OF TIME indicates that all life is born through the female (Durga) and that life cannot enter this world without coming through the female.

Be Healthy Be Happy.

4/3/20, 1:25 PM - Vikas Vidhyarthy Civil: I don't know who wrote this, but it's beautiful.. ♥

We fell asleep in one world, and woke up in another.

Suddenly Disney is out of magic,
Paris is no longer romantic,
New York doesn't stand up anymore,
the Chinese wall is no longer a fortress, and Mecca is empty.

Hugs & kisses suddenly become weapons, and not visiting parents & friends becomes an act of love.

Suddenly you realise that power, beauty & money are worthless, and can't get you the oxygen you're fighting for.

The world continues its life and it is beautiful. It only puts humans in cages. I think it's sending us a message:

"You are not necessary. The air, earth, water and sky without you are fine. When you come back, remember that you are my guests. Not my masters."

4/6/20, 7:44 AM - +91 99585 15757: India seems to be coronavirus free even though it is a close neighbor of China. 

There is a lot of speculation and eyebrows raised as to why this is so. 

Various reasons are being put out:

1) The Indian gene is Covid-19 resistant.
2) The low level of hygiene has made Indians immune to this virus.
3) The Indian curry might have ingredients that are antiviral.
4) Maybe the high level of chillies in our food help prevent lung infection by C-19.
5) The Indian habit of washing their hands and everything else may play a role.
6) Most Indians eat hot food and do not share their food. This prevents spread of infection.
7) The "Namaste"  helps, as people don't touch each other.
8) India has a warmer climate that is killing the C-19.
9) Indians are a lot vegetarian and even the non vegetarians can switch to vegetables. The meat eating has drastically dropped in India after the C-19 scare as per statistics.

In fact WHO and China are really wondering and trying to understand how a country of 1.38 billion can be coronavirus free ! 
God only knows and hope it stays this way.

4/8/20, 9:09 PM - DR Sir WhatsApp No: Dear SRM Family members,

As we all know the lockdown seems to likely to be extended till April 30th.(However we have to wait for government notification)
Let's actively start our admission activities and work from home to bring maximum number of students into our campus this year. 

We are fortunate to be working in an educational institution like SRM where we experience complete job satisfaction and freedom . So let's contribute our bit to our workplace by focussing seriously on improving admissions.

In the same regard, an *Inbound admission meeting* has been called by our Dean Admissions for tomorrow at 5pm. 
I expect all our faculties to participate and discuss the winning ways..

My SRM..MY RESPONSIBILITY

I thank all those who were a part of today's Inbound Admission Meeting..Many of you had offered productive suggestions and I appreciate the strategies you had putforth to improve admissions, may it be digital publicity or reaching out to parents.

I wish that these suggestions should take shape as practical implementation so that they will yield the expected success. The materials that were asked to be provided must be given at the earliest to madam Chandra. 

During the next meeting I expect all faculty members should participate and understand the preparations that is required to maximize our admission.

4/10/20, 1:54 PM - Chandra Madam: As directed by DR sir,

Dear  Faculty Members,

"We are in  the noble profession of grooming students to a better future.

We have to implement  those values we teach, in practical also.

We have to keep  ourselves presentable especially, during the  meetings and interactions,  because our own  children are also watching us at the time.

 I expect that, during the next meeting all the faculties will be in the  presentable attire.

We need active participation of all the faculty members by put forth thier suggestions and opinions to increase the admission.

Faculties must think about  for the institution, since admission is a major mandate placed on us.

Hence, you  should come out with your ideas to publicize the virtues of our campus.

*(Without decent admission count, this year things may not be as smooth as it has been in the past two years)*

I hope to see some changes in the upcoming meeting on next Thursday ( 16.4.2020)."

Further, sending the protocol to follow during the video conference or meeting and hope all will follow as mentioned.

4/13/20, 12:23 PM - Pankaj Singh Jio: Sir instead of screw driver and spanner on desktop, it may be electronic based circuits like satelite/ radar/ antennas...rest is ok.. thanks

4/14/20, 12:19 PM - +91 99999 90901: जानिए आरोग्य सेतु एप क्या है
इसे install करना क्यों आवश्यक है

आपमें से बहुतों ने इनस्टॉल किया
पर आपको लगा कि बेकार है
इसे आपने uninstall भी कर दिया होगा

मैंने भी दो तीन बार install किया फिर हटा दिया
पर मोदी जी ने फिर से बोला तो सोचना पड़ा 
ये जरूर कोई बहुत बड़ी चीज है

आप भी फिर से आरोग्य सेतु एप को install कीजिए
मोदी जी ने चार बार आपसे निवेदन किया है

अब जानिए..

यह एप्प आपसे कुछ पूछता है जैसे कि क्या आपको खांसी है
बुखार है
सांस लेने में परेशानी है

निश्चित है आप लिखेंगे
नहीं है

उसके बाद आप ग्रीन जोन में दिखते होंगे
आपको लगता होगा
इस एप्प में कुछ है ही नहीं
पूरा बकवास है

यह एप्प ब्लू टूथ और लोकेशन को ऑन रखने को कहता है
आप always on रखिये

जब भी आप किसी भीड़ भाड़ वाली जगह पर जाते हैं
यह एप्प ब्लू टूथ से आस पास के मोबाइल से संदेश लेता देता रहता है

जब आप किसी के पास खड़े हैं तो आप भी ग्रीन जोन के हैं
पास खड़ा व्यक्ति भी ग्रीन जोन वाला नार्मल व्यक्ति ही है
पर अगर वह व्यक्ति आज से 10 दिनों बाद किसी कारण से कोरोना पॉजिटिव हो जाएगा
तो यह एप्प आपको तुरंत alert कर देगा
और आपका ग्रीन कलर बदल कर ऑरेंज या पीला हो जाएगा

यह कहेगा
आप दूध लेने आज से 10 दिन पहले डेयरी पर गए थे
वह व्यक्ति जो नीले शर्ट वाला था
वह अब कोरोना पॉजिटिव है
यानी 10 दिन पहले उसे छिपा हुआ संक्रमण था जो अब साफ साफ दिखने लगा है

अब आप तुरंत अपनी जांच कराइए
साथ ही यह एप्प उन सभी व्यक्तियों को सूचना दे देगा
आप सभी लोग उस आदमी के चलते danger zone में आ गए हैं
तुरंत जांच कराइये

सबकी लोकेशन ऑन रहने से उन सभी की मूवमेंट भी पता चलेगी
और कोरोना से लड़ना आसान होगा

आप इस पोस्ट को व्हाट्सएप्प पर भेजिए
लोगों को समझाइए
जिस दिन करोड़ों लोग इसे install कर लेंगे
यह आपके किसी भी ऑरेंज जोन के व्यक्ति के पास जाते ही रिंग करने लगेगा
यह आपको हॉट स्पॉट की सूचना अलार्म से दे देगा 
ताकि आप रास्ता बदल लें

Thanks & Regards

It  is viewed with concern that some of the participants have not adhered to the instructions / etiquette circulated on the subject during the recent zoom conferences .  

In the best interests of  the Institution,  it is expected that such meetings are conducted in a professional manner with utmost  respect and sincerity to the proceedings. 

All participants are hereby requested to go through the circular and ensure strict compliance in all future meetings.

 HoDs are requested to observe deviations if any and take appropriate actions as deemed necessary.

 It is needless to emphasize that such meetings would be highly productive  if all participants adapt professional approach.

4/28/20, 7:20 PM - DR Sir WhatsApp No: Dear SRM family members.

For the past few days my self and all the dean's  in continuous interactions with our faculties as well as students.

I am exhilarated to receive amazing suggestions rendered during such meetings.

 One of our students suggested that courses offered at our campus should be first publicised among our own students as many do not know the details. 
Faculty members showed immense enthusiasm offering productive ideas on how to improve admissions and strategies that can be adapted. 
I am extremely hopeful that with such a dedicated team of faculties we will easily be able to achieve our admission target this year.
I thank and appreciate all such faculties who contributed competently during the meetings.
Thanks
With regards
DR

5/2/20, 6:39 PM - Mahapatra Sir: Difference in the SRM Scholarship provided on the website and the poster
1.	Website shows that the district topper in Tamil Nadu State only whereas in the poster it is mentioned that CBSE and State Board Toppers in each district of India.
2.	In the category of SRM Merit Scholarship, there is one more category of students have 90% and above in PCM / PCB in HSC will be awarded scholarship “as determined by the scholarship committee”.
5/2/20, 6:47 PM - SRM Verbal Dr Jayprakash: Sir, in my opinion, we can use To apply instead of To enroll as one must first apply for admission to study into a programme and then one can enrol into courses inside this programme once application is approved
5/2/20, 6:58 PM - Chandra Madam: This is to inform  that all the above 4 pages are under constructions.

 *DO NOT share these information to others.*

5/2/20, 7:26 PM - Daniel Sir Hod: 1) Sir under SCHOLARSHIPS heading,    total scholarship awarded can be ideally given for year 2019-20 instead of 2017-18.
2) Under SRM Founder's scholarship, apt word would be "sportspersons" instead of " sports persons"
3) Since verb has to be used, apt wordings would be "as determined by the Scholarship Committee" instead of "determinated" which is an used as adjective.

This is extremely critical time for all of us. We need to give our best to achieve the target of admissions. There should only and only one objective of everybody i.e. admissions. So, pull up the socks and give your best shot to achieve the best. We are forced to work from home due to COVID 19, so we need to utilize this time judiciously to spread the positive word for SRM. 
One thing I believe that "To get the best in life, give the best"

Greetings..

On behalf of SRM IST Delhi NCR Campus, I thank you for expressing your interest in taking admissions into our institution.

In continuation to our telecon, I am sending the three pages leaflet  for your detailed information regarding admissions 2020-21.

In case of further clarifications with regard to admissions, it is requested to please contact me and I am available at all times to address your queries. 

Welcome to the whole new world of opportunities awaiting you at SRM

Thank you..
5/3/20, 10:51 AM - DR Sir WhatsApp No: Dear members of SRM family,

I appreciate the efforts taken by our faculty members in supporting our admission process by calling students-parents and convincing them to opt for our campus.

In this regard and as discussed with our Dean admissions Prof. Mahapatra ji, I am sharing the revised leaflet of three pages that elaborates admission related information and also the content to be posted along with it.
All faculties are advised to share the greeting content and the three pages leaflet to all the potential admission seekers identified during the calls made.

Following up with interested candidates / parents is very important so that they are converted into admissions. Hence it is requested that all faculties must share this content and 3 pages leaflet immediately.

5/7/20, 11:05 AM - Pankaj Singh Jio: Dear Colleagues
I really appreciate that all are working for admission with full zeal and zest by calling the candidates and forwarding a positive word for SRMIST, Delhi NCE Campus. I also perceived the truth that faculties working out of box and convincing them to opt for the courses available at our campus.
As you all know, our academic session is over. Now we need to gear up to work more to achieve the target of  1560 admissions in our campus.
All facilities are getting 50 students data on daily basis. I request you all that please take this task very seriously. Moreover, please send SMS, leaflet of three pages /flyers that elaborates admission related information to all the potential admission seekers identified during the calling process.
Follow up of the interested candidates/  parents is very crucial so that they turn up for admissions.  Under the guidance of Dean Sir, DR Sir, Dean Admissions and Dean Campus life we need to work as a team and put our best to achieve the target.  Looking forward for your cooperation. 
Regards.

As shared by DR sir, the dates for SRMJEEE has been announced. The last date of application 15.07.2020 has also been announced. 
Now, we have very limited time to act, so we need to act fast. All the faculty members are making calls to promote SRMJEEE, you need to ensure that you broadcast this information, as much as you can. 
All the best...

5/26/20, 11:16 PM - DR Sir WhatsApp No: Dear SRM family members..

“Success usually comes to those who are busy looking for it”.

Congratulations team SRM NCR on successfully accomplishing the objectives of the admission activities during the first juncture through telephonic interaction with prospective candidates. I appreciate and applaud the efforts of our *Deans, all the HoDs, Dr. Chandra Sharadha, Dr. Dhowmya Bhatt.and all the faculty members.* 🙏🏻🙏🏻

Expecting the same quality of dedication and enthusiasm exhibited earlier by our faculties, Webinar series have been planned for the interested candidates as a part of extension activity in the second juncture.

Dr. Pankaj Singh and Dr. Chandra Shaaradha will specifically inform certain faculties and these faculties shall alone in turn inform interested candidates who sounded positive during telephonic conversation to participate in these webinar’s. 
Faculties who are instructed  shall only share the Registration link and the poster with the interested candidates. 
As we are planning webinars every week, all the candidates who showed interest will eventually be called and accordingly the respective faculty who spoke to them will be intimated and instructed. 

I hope to see the same zeal and commitment from our faculties in motivating the candidates to participate in the webinar. With persistent hardwork, I am hopeful that we will achieve the target of 1560.
Once again I acknowledge your efforts and wish our team keeps up the good work.

Sir, students photo should come.

5/27/20, 11:13 AM - Yogesh Kushwaha: Dear sir,
It is good experience and better way to express questions of participants. I have one suggestion that maximum students are northern part and their questions should be solved in Hindi only so we can reach maximum students.
5/27/20, 11:14 AM - Harendra Malik MCA Dept: Good idea for handling queries online
5/27/20, 11:14 AM - SRM Verbal Dr Jayprakash: Sir, Students should be tell in advance on how to join Webinar as most of them may not aware of it,

Thanks
5/27/20, 11:15 AM - Rohit Sharma: Dear sir, 
Mock session was really very good. I have one suggestion sir,

Is there any possiblity to provide the same platform for parents in parallel with students.
because most of the parents are very serious to choose good platform for their son or daughter.
I mean, two I'ds in same email, one for student and another one for parents (if they willing to join).

Thanks
5/27/20, 11:16 AM - +91 94118 44167: It was very nice session.
5/27/20, 11:16 AM - +91 98027 91675: Very interactive, nice and innovative session.

5/27/20, 11:17 AM - Meenakshi Sanidhya: Sir
Very nice session 
student face should come
5/27/20, 11:17 AM - +91 93594 33999: Nice and interacting session sir 
Although all points had been discussed. 
One small suggestion I want to offer sir
We need to focus on the safety measures for the students ,the medical facilities available in the campus and the placement along with the average and height package. 
Thank you sir.
5/27/20, 11:17 AM - Ajay Exam: Very nice session
5/27/20, 11:18 AM - Vikas Vidhyarthy Civil: It is a very nice and innovative idea  to clear the doubts of interested Students through the online  webinar. The mock webinar was really nice.
5/27/20, 11:19 AM - Daniel Sir Hod: Sir many parents are primarily concerned about the safety of their kids from pandemic. Many want to make their kids study in their locality itself. Hence a  presentation with photographic evidence of measures we have taken to control the spread and what we have planned for future, will give us good results.
5/27/20, 11:19 AM - Kamakshi Saxena: Gm Sir
It was a nice session. If Sarsawati vandana is played , it will seem more academically professional.
Regards.
5/27/20, 11:19 AM - Ranjana Mam: In Question Answer session we should prefer live answers.
As many of the attendees might not be well versed in typing. It takes more time. One question answered will be heard by all the members attending webinar.Live interaction will be the main attraction of webinar.
Rest all was good. Nice and great idea 👌
5/27/20, 11:19 AM - Yatendra HM: It was a nice mock session of the webinar. A very new and innovative idea to interact with our upcoming students.
 I have a suggestion sir,

Due to of the COVID 19 we can implement the Aarogya Setup App compulsory to all the students and the facultys as per the Government of India Norma and we can keep two or three quarantine room with doctors. If there is any emergency.

Regards

Yatendra Kumar
5/27/20, 11:20 AM - Mahesh Gupta, Sr.: It’s a good and new way of  attracting the new students and for me also it is a good idea .

5/27/20, 11:23 AM - Anna Alphy: Feedback : it really knowledgeable and interactive session.
Suggestions: there should be welcome session describing the aim of webinar & welcoming all students . 2) during question answer session it's good to unmute the participant 2 or 3 minutes before calling their name. So that they can wait for their turn to speak.3)both students and parents should be invited for webinar4)some PPT regarding common questions of after covid safety measures in classrooms and hostels and canteen with pictures of provision installed in campus.

6/15/20, 4:56 PM - +91 99999 90901: *तनाव के उन क्षणों में मजबूत लोग भी आत्महत्या कर लेते हैं..*

वो लोग जिनके पास सब कुछ है ..
*शान ... शौकत ... रुतबा ... पैसा .. इज्जत* 
इनमें से कुछ भी उन्हें नहीं रोक पाता ..  

तो फिर क्या कमी रह जाती है ???

*कमी रह जाती है उस ऊँचाई पर एक अदद दोस्त की*

*कमी होती है  उस मुकाम पर एक अदद राजदार की*

एक ऐसे दोस्त की जिसके साथ *"चांदी सोने के कपों"* में नहीं ,
*किसी छोटी सी चाय के दुकान पर भी बैठ सकते ..*

जो उन्हें बेतुकी बातों से जोकर बन कर  हंसा पाता ...

वह जिससे अपनी दिल की बात कह हल्के हो सके..
वह जिसको देखकर
अपना स्ट्रेस भूल सके

*वह दोस्त*
*वह यार* 
*वह राजदार* 
*वह हमप्याला*
उनके पास नहीं होता 
जो कह सके तू सब छोड़ ... *चाय पी मैं हूं ना तेरे साथ ...*
और आखिर में 
यही मायने कर जाता है...

सारी दुनिया की धन दौलत एकतरफ...सारा तनाव एक तरफ ..
*वह दोस्त वह एक तरफ !!!*

*लेकिन अगर आपके पास वह दोस्त है वह यार है*

*तो कीमत समझिये उसकी...* 

चले जाइए एक शाम उसके साथ चाय पर ... 
जिंदगी बहुत हसीन बन जाएगी...... 

*याद रखिए आपके तनाव से यदि कोई लड़ सकता है तो वो है आपका दोस्त और उसके साथ की एक कप गर्म चाय !!!*

There was a very brilliant boy, he always scored 100% in Science.

Got Selected for IIT Madras and scored excellent in IIT.

Went to the University of California for MBA.
Got a high paying job in America and settled there.

Married a Beautiful Tamil Girl.

Bought a 5 room big house and luxury cars.
He had everything that make him successful but a few years ago he committed suicide after shooting his wife and children.

*WHAT WENT WRONG?*

California Institute of Clinical Psychology Studied his case and found *“what went wrong?”*

The researcher met the boy's friends and family and found that he lost his job due to America’s economic crisis and he had to sit without a job for a long time. 

After even reducing his previous salary amount, he didn't get any job. 

Then his house installment broke and he and his family lost the home. 

They survived a few months with less money and then he and his wife together decided to commit suicide. 

He first shot his wife and children and then shot himself.

The case concluded that the man was Programmed for *success* but he was not *trained for handling failures*.

Now let's come to the actual question.

*What are the habits of highly successful people?*

First of all, I want to tell you that if you have achieved everything, there is a chance to lose everything, nobody knows when the next economic crisis will hit the world. 

*The best success habit is getting trained for handling failures*.

I want to request every parent, please do not only program your child to be *successful* but *teach them how to handle failures* and also teach them proper lessons about life. 

Learning high-level science and maths will help them to clear competitive exams but a knowledge about life will help them to face every problem.

Teach them about how *money works* instead of teaching them to *work for money*. 

Help them in finding their passion because these degrees will not help them in the next economic crisis and we don’t know when the next crisis will hit the world.

*"Success is a lousy teacher. Failure teaches you more."*

6/29/20, 11:48 AM - Dinesh Babu: Subject:IT Service Enhancement-NetID integration for E-Varsity.

Dear All,

Greetings from ITKM Team!!!

At ITKM we are working on a single-sign-on project since March-2019.

The objective of this project is to overcome the challenges facing by the organization/employee/students to manage multiple user ID & password for various applications, e-mail, networks, which is being used by SRM community over years.

We at ITKM receive numerous calls on resetting password, this is productivity loss for the users. An OTP based self service portal (https://ssp.srmist.edu.in) has been introduced in Jun`19. Anyone can reset password without any ITKM invention using this portal.

As initial step we have introduced NetID as single for every purpose. We have integrated NetID with E-mail & TeamDeck application & password reset portal. All future SRMIST application will be developed (i.e URP, mobile app) will be integrated with NetID.

As part of Single Sign On (SSO) initiative, from 1st July 2020 onwards you will be using your NetID credentials to login in E-Varsity.

The Existing employee id based username and password will not work for SRMIST user after 1st July 2020.

Thanks and Regards,
Dinesh Babu. K
Network Engineer & ERP In-charge

7/12/20, 7:22 AM - +91 96399 57994: Covid Medical kit Required at home:

3. Vitamin C and D3 
5. B complex 
6. Vapour+ capsules for steam
7. Oximeter 
8. Oxygen cylinder (for emergency only)

10.Breathing Exercises 

Covid Three stages:

*Stay healthy, Stay Safe!*
 Please fwd to your contacts in India. You never know who it may help. 
Tata Group has started good initiative, they are providing free doctors consultation online through chats. This facility is started for you so that you need not to go out for doctors and you will be safe at home.

Below is the link, I reqest everyone to take benefit of this facility.

Advice from inside isolation hospitals, we can do at home
 Medicines that are taken in isolation hospitals
 1. Vitamin C-1000
 2. Vitamin E (E)
 3. From (10 to 11) hours, sitting in the sunlight for 15-20 minutes.
 4. Egg meal once ..
 5. We take a rest / sleep a minimum of 7-8 hours
 6. We drink 1.5 liters of water daily
 7. All meals should be warm (not cold).
 And that's all we do in the hospital to strengthen the immune system

 Note that the pH of coronavirus varies from 5.5 to 8.5

 Therefore, all we have to do to eliminate the virus is to consume more alkaline foods above the acidity level of the virus.
 Such as :
 Bananas 
 Green lemon - 9.9 pH
 Yellow Lemon - 8.2 pH
 Avocado - 15.6 pH
 * Garlic - 13.2 pH
 * Mango - 8.7 pH
 * Tangerine - 8.5 pH
 * Pineapple - 12.7 pH
 * Watercress - 22.7 pH
 * Oranges - 9.2 pH

 How to know that you are infected with corona virus?

 1. Itchy throat
 2. Dry throat
 3. Dry cough
 4. High temperature
 5. Shortness of breath
 6. Loss of smell ....
 And lemon with warm water eliminates the virus at the beginning before reaching the lungs ...
 Do not keep this information to yourself. Provide it to all your family and friends.

7/15/20, 12:38 PM - +91 88263 35514: Good Afternoon Everyone,
On this joyous occasion of The Birthday of Our Hon’ble Pro Chancellor Sir and Respected Deputy Registrar Sir we have planned an e-quiz session during *Staff Welfare Day Celebration* .
Please make the following Pre-requisites done before attending the meeting
1.Kindly download Kahoot! App on your mobile before joining the meeting scheduled for today The link is provided below.
2. Another way to play is that u can directly go to url www.kahoot.it
3. I also urge everyone to take/attend  the session from another device other than the one on which Kahoot! app is installed in order to be hassle free and smooth session ( avoid switching the screen between the zoom and Kahoot app) . So try to keep 2 devices with u(in case u r not having 2 devices you can play with one too).
Confirm everyone after installing the Kahoot app. If anyone has any query/ issue , kindly feel free to ask the same.

Thanks & Regards
Ms.Priyanka Sharma

7/17/20, 4:47 PM - DR Sir WhatsApp No: Dear faculty members 

I am disappointed to witness the lethargic attitude of our faculty today when I found that many of them had not joined for the webinar. 
The institution has been closed considering your safety as our priority which doesn’t mean faculty will skip their responsibilities that needs to be discharged from home.  Especially when all these webinar’s are targeted towards admissions, there can be no excuses heard for not joining. 
The admission process must be taken with utmost seriousness and the peripheral activities like the webinar and other publicity act are also equally important.
It’s not appreciable that faculty are disinterested and unsupportive in the institution level activities.
I advise all the concerned to take things seriously and the right time is now.

7/25/20, 6:53 PM - DR Sir WhatsApp No: Dear faculty members 

After going through the photographs that were taken yesterday for the new website, I feel that they are not professional enough because the faculty members despite having been given with prior information to come groomed properly have not paid heed to the instructions.

Only few of the faculty appear to have dressed appropriately and are presentable enough.

Therefore it has been decided to repeat the photo shoot. Faculty of Computer Science Engineering should come ready for the reshoot.

All faculty and staff members of the institution shall be dressed formally both on 27th and 28th for taking photographs adhering strictly to dress code given below-

Male Faculty- 
Coat -  Black, Brown or Blue
Plain shirt - white or blue colour only 
Tie and ID card

Female Faculty- 
Formal Saree & ID card 

Lab Technicians 
Shirt & Pant in formal colour and Tie.

As instructed on 23/7/2020, no leave of any form will be sanctioned on these two days.

The photo shoot is being done for our new website and sooner we provide these photos our website will be professional and full fledged.

 I shall personally be monitoring the whole photo shoot on these days. 

Please understand that we don’t have much time to be lethargic and this is a serious business. I hope things to be perfect on Monday so that neither of time gets wasted.

I expect each an everyone to cooperate sincerely.

8/8/20, 5:47 PM - DR Sir WhatsApp No: Dear Dr. Pankaj Singh

We have hosted today's webinar after a gap of 15 days.
Despite that, the external participation and total count of attendees was extremely low. Why is it so? 
This is very disappointing and will not solve the purpose of holding such  webinars which is purely for the sake of admission activities.
I had expected more seriousness and dedication in bringing aspirants to listen our alumni and such important title should have automatically brought attendees.
Where is the lacking?

Deputy Registrar
8/8/20, 6:44 PM - Pankaj Singh Jio: Respected Sir,

With due respect, I would like to say that, it is a very disgraceful issue of less attendance in the webinar.

It is really disappointing situation to get such response inspite of putting lots of efforts.

In my point of view, because many faculties were taking labs till 03:30 pm, so they were unavailable for the webinar. But after completion of the lab working hours all facilities should have joined.

But, I will see to it that next time onwards each member of SRM family put 100% effort to make these admission events successful.

We really need to take strong action on it and I am assuring you on behalf of SRM family that we will bring more external participations next time.

Thanks & Regards

8/9/20, 11:12 AM - Dean New: Dear Dr. Pankaj,

These webinars are being organized for engineering and other courses aspirants. So, please try to bring more aspirants/parents in the said webinars to make it successful.
As the theory  classes are over by 3:00pm, except lab period which is  over by 3:30 pm, only few faculty have labs and can join after that accordingly. 
In view of above, I request DR sir to please change the starting time of webinar to  3:30pm  so that  the classes can run smoothly.

Thanks...

Many Congratulations to all of you.
A total number of 1221 candidates have opted for our campus as the first step of counselling.
Your hard work has paid off well. I appreciate each one of you.

Now it’s through our consistent follow up, we can convert this 1221 into admissions and bring them to our campus. The list of these candidates is available with our Dean admissions Dr.R.P.Mahapatra Sir 

Therefore it is my request that all faculty and staff should stay back and call all these candidates today itself to counsel and guide them to complete admission process in our campus.
To support Dean Admissions and the team all of us will stay back at the campus upto 6 pm today and call each and every candidate in the list.

Our team work, dedication and commitment has led us to the winning situation. Let’s grab the victory with little more hard work.

Come on  team.. let’s together achieve our target. ✌🏻

8/13/20, 9:47 AM - DR Sir WhatsApp No: Dear faculty and staff members 

I appreciate your enthusiasm and commitment in bringing maximum number of admissions to our campus this year. 

Your hard work shines bright in every single aspect, may it be calling, follow-up,counselling students and parents or answering their queries patiently.

After approaching the candidates who initially showed interest,300 students are willing to take admissions.

This 300 interested candidates should be followed up continuously and must be guided to take admissions in our campus. 

Please understand that they have only shown interest and now it’s our turn that we must show our interest in urging them take admissions in NCR campus.

So my advice and request to all of you is that we should not leave any stone unturned to convert this 300 interested candidates into admissions. 

Calls, messages, guidance and continuous follow up will make them feel that we are extremely keen about making them take admissions into our campus and this contagious enthusiasm will alone help us beat competition.

I trust the abilities of each member of team NCR and hope that they will convert each interested candidates into a SRMite of our campus.

8/16/20, 9:38 AM - DR Sir WhatsApp No: Dear Hods and Faculty member's

This is to inform you that we have planned to have one to one Zoom Meeting with the prospective aspirants of our NCR  campus who can be counselled at this point of time and thus making them take admissions at NCR campus.
The meeting will be held in batches of 20-25 candidates for a duration of 30 minutes. 
10 such batches will be counselled each day starting from tomorrow from 9.30am onwards.

The Zoom Meeting has been titled 
“ ADMISSION cum CAREER GUIDANCE”.

All our Deans will be present for the meeting and HoD, CDC & Placement will be in the meeting.

It is expected that one Hod should be present for each  meeting so that aspirants can meet and interact with the concerned in one single platform.

Dr. Chandra Shaaradha will share the details of the meeting with you.

The faculty members of all the departments have been calling these candidates who have opted for NCR Campus. It is advised that all the faculty should cooperate with madam Chandra as this is our last attempt in converting these candidates as admissions into NCR campus.

    Dean Campus life...

My professional life would have been a tragedy if you were not my colleague.

The pillars of a happy office are not made from cement but from the enthusiastic colleague and friends like you.

Management books can never teach you real teamwork. Only efficient person like you can. 

 I’m grateful to you for so many reasons. 

Happy birthday to the most amazing person in the world!

Best wishes
Viswanathan

9/5/20, 7:30 AM - Dean New: Wish you all a very happy teacher's day.

A teacher do more than teach. They foster social responsibility, broaden imaginations, and offer encouragement and support. The way a teacher perceives his / her job can directly impact any influence on students - academically, behaviourally and emotionally.

Proud to be a teacher...

9/5/20, 9:55 AM - SRM Verbal Dr Jayprakash: एक शिक्षक और एक छात्र के रूप में जीवन और दुनिया (प्रकृति और लोगों सहित) के बीच एक बहुत ही अनूठा संबंध है क्योंकि यह दुनिया ही मुझे जीवन का सार सिखाती है। मेरे जीवन में हर कोई मुझे कुछ सिखाता है, जैसे एक तूफान के दौरान, प्रकृति हमेशा मुझे शांति का पाठ पढ़ाती है, पहाड़ मुझे सिखाते हैं कि कैसे मजबूत होना चाहिए, पानी का प्रवाह मुझे अपने काम में लगातार रहना सिखाता है। उसी तरह, मेरे आसपास के लोग मुझे हर पल कुछ नया सिखा रहे हैं, उन सभी को शिक्षक दिवस की बहुत बहुत शुभकामनाएं।

9/17/20, 8:39 AM - Naresh Sharma: *A very interesting story*

One Sunday morning, a wealthy man sat in his balcony enjoying sunshine and his coffee when a little ant caught his eye which was going from one side to the other side of the balcony carrying a big leaf several times more than its size.

 The man watched it for more than an hour. He saw that the ant faced many obstacles during its journey, paused, took a diversion and then continued towards destination.

At one point the tiny creature came across a crack in the floor. It paused for a little while, analyzed and then laid the huge leaf over the crack, walked over the leaf, picked the leaf on the other side then continued its journey.

The man was captivated by the cleverness of the ant, one of God’s tiniest creatures. The incident left the man in awe and forced him to contemplate over the miracle of Creation. It showed the Greatness of the Creator. 

In front of his eyes there was this tiny creature of God, lacking in size yet equipped with a brain to analyze, contemplate, reason, explore, discover and overcome.

A while later the man saw that the creature had reached its destination – a tiny hole in the floor which was entrance to its underground dwelling.

 And it was at this point that the ant’s shortcoming that it shared with the man was revealed. 

How could the ant carry into the tiny hole the large leaf that it had managed to carefully bring to the destination? It simply couldn't! So the tiny creature, after all the painstaking and hard work and exercising great skills, overcoming all the difficulties along the way, just left behind the large leaf and went home empty-handed.

The ant had not thought about the end before it began its challenging journey and in the end the large leaf was nothing more than a burden to it. 

The creature had no option, but to leave it behind to reach its destination. 

The man learned a great lesson that day.

That is the truth about our lives too.

We worry about our family, we worry about our job, we worry about how to earn more money, we worry about where we should live, what kind of vehicle to buy, what kind of dresses to wear, what gadgets to upgrade, only to abandon all these things when we reach our destination – We don’t realize in our life’s journey that these are just burdens that we are carrying with utmost care and fear of losing them, only to find that at the end they are useless and we can’t take them with us.....

9/22/20, 8:55 PM - Pankaj Singh Jio: Dear all,

It is appreciable that all the SRM family members are working very rigorously to complete our admission target.

Some faculty members are working long hours in admission cell and mostly are calling everyday to bring students.

After working so hard we have reached half the way to our destination. We still need to cover the remaining half.
 
In this regard I request all the family members to put their maximum efforts for few more days so as to reach the target.

If everyone honestly calls the students and bring them on zoom portal, then our hardworking zoom team definitely clear his doubts and can turn into it an admission.

Remember when spiders unite, they can tie down a lion.

We need your support. 

Thanks and Regards

10/20/20, 9:59 AM - DR Sir WhatsApp No: Dear Nitin

The basic purpose of media coverage for any programme is to broadcast our campus activities amongst public. However this task should be done appropriately.

Whenever any activities may it be co-curricular or extracurricular, the focus should be on the invited guest and not the internal members of our campus.
For instance, the photo of the chief guest for the FDP Programme Prof Rajat Gupta should have been on the news instead of mine.

The Director of NIT Mizoram being present for our programme is the news and this is what people want to see and listen from a brand like us.

The news of FDP with my photograph is totally mindless. 

Therefore in all future Campus activities and programmes where news / photographs are being sent to media, prior permission should be taken from my office. 
Without approvals no photographs shall be sent to media.

All the Hods and event coordinators should note this and adhere without deviations.

Team ISTE 'SRM is very happy to invite first year students to participate in one of the biggest annual event by us. We present to you the event *Mock Placement '20 + workshop on competitive programming*. Mock Placement will give you the experience of how real placements happen. Their will be a exclusive workshop on competitive programming after the Mock Placement. Please find various details about event and ISTE below.

*WHAT IS ISTE?*
I.S.T.E (Indian Society for Technical Education) is a national, professional, non-profit making, government aided society, started in 1941 as the "Association of Principals of Technical Education (A.P.T.I)". The Students' chapter of ISTE was started in 2007 in our campus.

*OUR VISION AND MISSION:*
Colleges only focusing on theoretical knowledge and not on what the industry really expects from a professional, ISTE'S main objective is to assist and contribute in the production and development of the professionals in the industry. We conduct many events which target a particular set of skills which help in developing general logic, perception and creativity among the students, like workshops for embedded systems, digital marketing, programming languages like C++, Java, HTML, various quizzes, Forums and much more. In a nutshell I.S.T.E has striven to make every student at par with any other professional of that particular field.

10/25/20, 10:27 AM - Naveen Ahlawat: विजयादशमी इस बात की प्रतीक है कि असत्य के रावण का सत्य के 'राम' द्वारा अंत निश्चित है।विजयादशमी का महापर्व मनुष्य को अधर्म, अहंकार और असत्य का परित्याग कर धर्म, विवेक और सत्य के मार्ग पर चलने की प्रेरणा व शिक्षा देने वाला पर्व है।

अत्याचार पर सदाचार, पाप पर पुण्य, दम्भ पर विनम्रता, क्रोध पर करुणा, आसुरी प्रवृत्ति पर सद्वृत्तियों की विजय के महापर्व विजयादशमी की सभी को अनन्त शुभकामनाएं
प्रभु श्री राम हमें बुराइयों पर विजय प्राप्त करने की शक्ति दें।

'विजयादशमी' की हार्दिक शुभकामनाएँ 

जय श्री राम!

सियावर रामचंद्र की जय!

10/26/20, 7:45 PM - DR Sir WhatsApp No: Dear members of SRM family 

I am happy to share that we have reached today 650 admissions in terms of numbers. It’s a great news for all of us.

I appreciate and congratulate each and every member of the campus who have all tirelessly worked to achieve these many numbers even among this pandemic circumstances. 

The faculty and staff members have left no students unturned when it comes to counselling students for taking admissions into our campus and it’s only because of their sincere, dedicated and committed efforts and enthusiasm, we have got decent numbers this year. 

As you are aware that admissions will go on till 30th November 2020 as per AICTE guidelines, it’s my advise to all the concerned that we should aim for higher numbers. 
I expect that the team will atleast bring another 100-150 admissions within the deadline.

I wish the team the best and may their efforts yield fruitful results so that we achieve our basic target. 

Deputy Registrar

11/14/20, 1:19 PM - Ranjana Mam: This Diwali is different. This Diwali is not about whether my house is sparkling clean, it is not about whether I have prepared a variety of mithais and namkeens, it is not about whether I have that perfect ethnic attire and jewelry for the occasion, it is not about a bucketful of bucks I would be spending on shopping and firecrackers, it is not about having a grand vacation at an exotic location, it is not even about whether I got a promotion or a raise...

This Diwali is more about Survival. It is about being grateful that we are still able to breathe and alive for this day. It is about being thankful for the love and care from our loved ones, It is about being with the family under one roof and spending time together, It is about lighting a Diya for all those dear and near souls who left us, It is about extending support and spreading cheer to family and friends who have lost their people...It is about spreading happiness to those who have suffered losses in jobs and businesses... 

This Diwali is more about being hopeful, for a healthy & happy tomorrow.

HAPPY DIWALI 😊🙏

நீண்ட பதிவுதான்  அவசியம்  படிங்க
 என்னை மிகவும் பாதித்த பதிவு !

*படிக்கும்போதே  உயிர் பிரிவதைப் போன்றவோர் உணர்வு !*

பகிர்வு:

அப்பா, 
நேத்து கேட்டேனே, எக்ஸாம் பீஸ் எடுத்துக்கவா...?

கேட்டுக் கொண்டே அப்பா நேற்று போட்டிருந்த சட்டைப் பாக்கெட்டில் கை விடுகிறான்.

டேய், அப்பா வந்து எடுத்து தருவாங்க, பாக்கெட்டில் கை விடறது என்ன பழக்கம்...? 

அம்மாவின் அதட்டலுக்கு...

என் அப்பா பாக்கெட்டில் நான் கை விடறேன், உனக்கு ஏம்மா வயிறு எரியுது...?

அம்மாவிற்கு பதில் சொல்லிக் கொண்டே, எடுத்ததை தன் பாக்கெட்டில் நுழைத்தவாறு, தேங்க்ஸ்பா, பாய்... சொன்னவாறு ஓடிப் போனான், மூன்றாமாண்டு பொறியியலில் இயந்திரவியல் படிக்கும் ராஜா.

எல்லாம் நீங்க கொடுக்கற செல்லம். எதுக்கும் ஒரு அளவு இருக்குதுங்க, பொறிந்தாள் அப்பளம் பொறித்தபடி.

சிரித்தபடியே தலைதுவட்டிக் கொண்டு வெளியே வந்த குமாரசாமி, 

நேத்து ஒரு ஃப்ரெண்ட் கேண்டீன்ல செலவு பண்ணியிருப்பான், இவன் ஒருநாள் செலவு பண்ண ஆசைபடுவான், இதுக்கெல்லாம் உங்கிட்ட கணக்கு சொல்லமுடியுமா?

அதுவுமில்லாம நீ பயப்படற மாதிரிலாம் தப்பா நீ வளர்க்கலய மகா...! காலையிலய கோபப்படாதடா, டாக்டர் சொன்னாரில்லையா... என்றபடி மனைவியின் கன்னத்தில் செல்லமாய் தட்டியபடி... ரூமிற்குள் நுழைந்து புறப்பட தயாரானார் அலுவலகத்திற்கு.

யாரு டாக்டரு, உங்க ஃப்ரெண்ட் தானே...

நீங்க சொல்லிக் கொடுக்கறத, அப்படியே வந்து ஒப்பிப்பாரு, எனக்குத் தெரியாதா...?ஒங்க ரெண்டு பேர பத்தியும்...

சொல்லிக் கொண்டே காபியுடன் வெளிவந்த மகாவை...

என்னம்மா, காலையிலயே என்னை போட்டுட்ட மிக்ஸியில... சொல்லியபடி உள்ளே நுழைந்தார் பக்கத்து வீட்டு டாக்டரும் குமாரசாமியின் பால்ய நண்பருமான ரத்னவேல்.

மகா, நாக்கை கடித்துக்கொண்டு அசடு வழிந்தபடி, இந்தாங்கண்ணா, உங்களுக்குத்தான் காபி, என்றாள்.

நம்பாதடா, நம்பாதடா, இவ்ளோ நேரம் அவ்ளோ திட்டு திட்டினாள் உன்னை, சிரித்தபடி வெளியே வந்த குமாரசாமியிடம், 

என் தங்கை என்னை திட்டினா, திட்டட்டும், என்னைத் தானே திட்டறா, உனக்கென்ன என்றார் ரத்னவேல் சிரித்துக்கொண்டே.

ஒன்னு அசடு வழியுது...

ஒன்னு வெட்கமே இல்லாம பேசுது...

ஆளை விடுங்க சாமி, என்றபடி தன்னிடம் தந்த காபியை வாங்கி குடிக்கத் தொடங்கினார். 

திடீரென அரண்டு எழுந்தார் குமாரசாமி.

#கனவு.

திரும்பி செல்போனை எடுத்து நேரம் பார்த்தார்.

5:20.

பத்து நிமிடம் கழித்து எழுந்து கொள்ளலாம் என நினைத்தபடி, ஈரமான கண்களை துடைத்தபடி திரும்பி படுக்கிறார். 

தன் மருமகள் மகனிடம் பேசுகிறாள்...

என்னங்க, நான் சொல்றது கேட்பீங்களா, கேட்க மாட்டீங்களா...? 

என்ன ஷீலா, நீ சொல்லி நான் எதை கேட்கல...?
காலையிலயே கோபப்படற‌. 

பின்ன என்னங்க, நானும் மூனு மாசமா சொல்றேன், செய்யறீங்களா...?

எதை சொல்ற...?

ஹூம்... அது மட்டும் மறந்துடுமே...

உங்கப்பாவை எங்கயாவது தூரமான ஊருல முதியோர் இல்லத்தில சேருங்கனு சொல்லிக்கிட்டு இருக்கேனே... அதைத்தான்.

இந்த மாசம் ஏற்பாடு பண்றேன் ஷீலா, கொஞ்சம் பொறுத்துக்கோடா.... என்கிறான்.

குமாரசாமியின் கண்களின் பக்கவாட்டில் நீர் வழிந்து, காதுகளை தொடுகிறது. 

துடைத்துக் கொண்டே நினைத்துக் கொள்கிறார்.

ஏங்க, எனக்கு ஒங்கள நெனச்சாதாங்க கவலையா இருக்கு...?

இவுங்ககிட்ட உங்களால தாக்கு பிடிக்க முடியுமானு தெரியலையே...?

உங்கள அனாதையா விட்டுட்டு போறேனே... 

ஏங்க, சீக்கிரம் வந்துடுங்க... நான் உங்களுக்கா காத்துகிட்டு இருப்பேன், சரியா...!

எல்லாரையும் உள்ளங்கையில வைச்சித் தாங்கனீங்க, ஆனால் ...

மேற்கோண்டு பேச முடியாமல் தேம்பும் மனைவியின் கண்ணைத் துடைத்தபடி, 

உனக்கு ஒன்னும் இல்லையாம்டா...
இப்போதான் ரத்னம் சொல்லிட்டுப் போறான்...

நீ இன்னும் ஒரு வாரத்துல எழுந்து அவனுக்கு காபி போட்டு கொடுப்பியாம், சொன்னான்.

அழுகையை அடக்கிய படி ஆறுதல் சொல்ல, 

எல்லாத்தையும் நானும் கேட்டுட்டேங்க...!

எனக்கு நான் போவதை பத்திலாம் கவலையே இல்லங்க... உங்கள நெனச்சாதான். 

தன் மடியில் மனைவி தன்னை விட்டுப் போனதை நினைத்துப் பார்த்தபடி படுத்திருக்கிறார்.

ஏங்க, மணி 7:20 ஆகுது, உங்கப்பாவை எழுப்புங்க, நியூஸ் போயிடுச்சினா, உலகமே இரண்ட மாதிரி ஆயிடுவாரு உங்கப்பா.

என்னவோ இவர கேட்டுதான் உலகமே இயங்கற மாதிரி...

சொல்லிக்கொண்டே மனைவி தந்த காபியை வாங்கிக் கொண்டு போய்... அப்பா, காஃபி... என்றவாறே அவர் அருகிலிருந்த டீப்பாயின் மீது வைத்து விட்டு உள்ளே போய்விட்டான்.

அய்ந்து நிமிடம் கழித்து வெளியே வந்தவன், காபி எடுக்காததை கண்டு, 

அப்பா, அப்பா...
இரண்டு தடவை கூப்பிட...

பதில் வரவில்லை.

ஒரே குரலுக்கு பதில் தரும் அப்பாவிற்கு என்ன ஆயிற்று...?

உடம்பு சரியில்லையோ...?

மெல்ல குனிந்து அப்பாவின் கையை தொட்டு உலுக்குகிறான் அப்பா, அப்பா...!?!?!

சற்றே அதிர்ச்சியோடு தற்போது கன்னத்தை இருபுறமும் பிடித்து...
தலையை ஆட்டுகிறான், அப்பா, அப்பா...!

இவன் கத்தும் சத்தம் கேட்டு ரத்னவேல் உள்ளே வருகிறார், 
என்ன ராஜா...?

தெரியல அங்கிள், நாலஞ்சு தடவை கூப்பிட்டும் எந்திரிக்கவே மாட்டேங்கிறாரு...?

ரத்னவேல் மெல்ல உட்கார்ந்து...

கையைத் தூக்கி பல்ஸ் பார்க்கிறார்.

கையை கீழே வைத்தபடி...

தன் நண்பனை மெல்ல குனிந்து முகத்தைப் பார்க்கிறார்.

மேலும் குனிந்து குமார், குமார் என குரல் கொடுத்தபடி...

இரண்டு கன்னத்திலும் முத்தமிட்டு விட்டு எழுகிறார்.

என்ன அங்கிள்...?

திரும்பி கண்ணாடியை கழட்டுகிறார். 

#கண்ணீர்_அதற்குள்_கழுத்தை_தொடுகிறது.

அவன் தோளை தட்டியபடி, அவன் மகாகிட்ட போயிட்டாம்பா... 
சொல்லிக் கொண்டே வெளியேறுகிறார்.

மாலை 4 மணி.

இறுதி ஊர்வலத்திற்கான ஏற்பாடுகளை கவனித்துக் கொண்டிருந்த ரத்னவேலுவை நோக்கி, 

பால்ய நண்பர்கள்  ஆறேழு பேர் வருகின்றனர்.

டேய், நீ ஒரு டாக்டரு, இவ்ளோ நாளா அவனை செக் பண்ணாமயாட இருந்த...? எரிச்சலோடு சேகர் கேட்கிறார்.

நிமிர்ந்து ஒரு பார்வை. அவ்வளவுதான்.

ஒட்டிப்பிறந்த ரெட்டையனுங்க மாதிரியே சுத்தித் திரிஞ்சிங்களேடா...
அவனுக்கு ஹார்ட்ல பிராப்ளம் இருக்கிறது உனக்குத் தெரியாமலா இருந்தது...? பாலாவின் கேள்வி.

அவன்கிட்ட கூட காசை எதிர்பார்த்தியோ...? சம்பத்.

எதற்கும் பதிலில்லை.

சிவா அவரைப் பிடித்து திருப்புகிறார்.
என்னடா, நாங்க கேட்டுகிட்டே இருக்கோம், அவனை அனுப்பற வேலையிலயே இருக்க...? 

அவர் கண்கள் முழுக்க கண்ணீர்...!

சிவாவின் தோளை பாலா தொட்டார்.
சிவா அமைதியாயிருடா. 

அவன், அவங்கம்மா செத்ததுக்கே கலங்காதவன். 
எப்படி அழறான், பாரு.
அவனை பேச வை.
எனக்கு பயமாயிருக்கு... பாலா தவிப்போடு சொல்ல,

பேசுடா, என்ன நடந்ததுன்னு சொல்லுடா... உலுக்குகிறார் சிவா.

அவன் செத்து மூனு வருஷமாச்சு.

நாமதான் லேட்டா கண்டுக்குறோம்... என்கிறார் ரத்னவேல்.

எல்லோரும் அதிர்ச்சியாகி பார்க்க...

ஆமாம்டா... அவன் செத்து மூனு வருஷமாச்சு.

மூன்று
ஆண்டுகளுக்கு முன்னால்... 
மகா போனபோதே அவனும் போயிட்டான்.
நாமதான் கவனிக்கல...!

அதுக்கப்புறம், "சாப்பிட்டியா?"
என்று கேட்க கூட யாரும் இல்லாத 
நேரத்திலேயே அவன் செத்துட்டான்; ஆனால் நாமதான்  கவனிக்கல...!?!

"பொண்டாட்டி போனதுமே போய்த் தொலைய வேண்டியதுதானே" 
என்று தம் காதுபடவே -  மருமகள் பேசியபோதே அவன் போயிட்டான்; அப்போதும் நாமதான் கவனிக்கல...!

'தாய்க்குப் பின் தாரம்... 
தாரத்துக்குப் பின் வீட்டின் ஓரம்...!'
என்று அனைவராலும் புறக்கணிக்கப்பட்டு 
வாழும்நிலை வந்தபோதே 
அவன் போயிட்டான்; நாமதான் யாருமே கவனிக்கல...!

"காசு இங்கே மரத்திலேயா காய்க்குது"  என்று மகன் அமில வார்த்தையை 
வீசியபோதே அவன் போயிட்டான்;
நாமதான் கவனிக்கல...!

நேத்து விடிகாலம் வாக்கிங் போகறதுக்காக, 
அவனை எழுப்ப கதவை தட்டப் போனேன்...
அப்போ...

"என்னங்க... ரொம்ப தூரத்திலே இருக்குற முதியோர் இல்லத்திலே விட்டுவிட்டுத் தலைமுழுகிட்டு வந்திடுங்க...!" என்று மருமகளின் சுடுசொற்கள்... 

என் காதில் விழுந்தது போல் அவனும் கேட்டிருப்பானு நெனைக்கிறேன்.

அதான் போயிட்டான், தூரமா...!
என்று கதறிய ரத்னவேலை...

பாலா தழுவிக்கொண்டே தட்டிக் கொடுத்தார்.

நேத்து பழைய ரிமோட்ட கையில வச்சிகிட்டு உட்கார்ந்திருந்தான், சேனலை மாத்துடா, என்னடா இந்தி பாட்டு கேட்கிற...? என்றபோது... 

அதோ இருக்கு பாரு ரிமோட்டு, மாத்திக்கோ என்றான்.
நீ வச்சிருக்கயே அது என்னடா? என்றபோது...

இது போயிடிச்சி, ஆனா மகா யூஸ் பண்ணது என்றான்.

#பார்க்கும்_எல்லாவற்றிலும்_அவன்_மகாவோடு_வாழ்ந்தான்.

ஒருவேளை மகன் நம்மை முதியோர் இல்லத்தில் விட்டுவிட்டால்....? என்று நினைக்கும்போதே செத்துட்டிருப்பான்...!

அவனுக்கு ஒரு பிராப்ளமும் இல்லடா...! என்று கதறும் Dr.ரத்னத்தை ஆற்றுப்படுத்த வழியின்றி....

எல்லோரும் அழுகின்றனர்...

*தோழர்களே...!*

நீங்கள் செல்லும் வழியிலும்
இப்படி யாராவது
இறந்து கொண்டிருப்பார்கள்... 

ஓரிரு மணித் துளிகளாவது 
நின்று பேசிவிட்டுச் செல்லுங்கள்...! 

இல்லையேல்...

உங்கள் அருகிலேயே - 
உங்கள் வீட்டிலேயே இறந்து கொண்டிருப்பார்கள்... 
புரிந்து கொள்ள முயலுங்கள்...!

வாழ்க்கை என்பது... 
வாழ்வது மட்டுமல்ல...! 
வாழ வைப்பதும்தான்...!

சுடுசொற்களால், புறக்கணிப்பால்... 
பலர் 
உயிருடனேயே இறந்து விடுகின்றனர். 
புதைக்கத்தான்
சில ஆண்டுகள் ஆகின்றன...!🙏

இந்தக் கதையை படிக்கும் எல்லோருக்கும் ஒரு வேண்டுகோள்...!

*நிச்சயம் இது உங்களுக்கான கதை அல்ல... நம்புகிறேன்...!*

உங்களுக்கானதாக மாறிவிடக் கூடாது என்றும் வேண்டுகிறேன்...

An excellent news to start our day with..
SRM IST is among the top institutions of the country that have published more than 1500 research papers in 2020.
The campus wise breakup indicates that we have 78 papers to the credit of NCR faculty members.
Kudos to each of the faculty for such commendable achievement. I appreciate their persistent hard work and orientation to research. I understand that a credible publication does not come easily.. True to being role models, our faculty members have committed themselves to research and innovation because of which this achievement has been possible.
I expect all our faculty members will contribute to research activities like paper and patent publications. This way we will to aim for more number of publications through our campus in the upcoming days.

Once again congratulations to all papers publishers and my best wishes.

1/6/21, 5:45 PM - DR Sir WhatsApp No: Dear faculty members 

After today’s discussions on research activities,I wish that what we decided should be implemented so that our campus can independently achieve laurels. 
The individual contribution to this will be highly commendable. 

The faculty must have yearly goals
Two quality research papers in Scopus and one in SCI.
Thereafter Slowly Try for publication in free journals instead of paid journals

You are encouraged to Patent your ideas and publications

Book writing should be done by faculties with 10 years and more experience 

All faculties should apply for funding projects in the upcoming academic year 2021

Make it your new year resolution that each one of you must get a funded project.
 
Fund from many agency is going waste because professors like you don’t apply for it .Utilise them this year 

Make it a habit to Daily check DST AICTE,UGC and other website 
Start your day by checking these websites. You will automatically get ideas after certain time.

Faculty members already having credible publications in SCI and Scopus indexed journals may mail a copy of the same to the HR Manager.
A database of publications will be created for our campus.

I request all faculty members to support.

Though wide known but reiterating
Vitamin D is made by the body with sunlight.

Sesame seeds (til) have the highest calcium (975mg per 100g). Milk has 125mg only.

The body is capable of storing vitamin D up to a year, and use the reserves.

Lastly, the body is capable of getting its vitamin D reserves full with 3 full days of sunlight.

The best quality of sunlight is end of winter & beginning of summer.

*Now join the dots, and see how wise our sages were in ancient India.*

They created a festival of flying kites where by our kids get excited to go in the open, under direct sunlight, throughout the day starting from early morning. And their mothers feed them homemade TIL ladoos.

Under the aegis of Ministry of Road transport & Highways, Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) marked the beginning of National Road Safety month with the inauguration of first ever Virtual Road Safety Educative Gallery in the state capital. Shri Rajnath Singh, Honorable Defense Minister and Shri Nitin Gadkari, Honorable Minister of Ministry of Road Transport & Highways inaugurated the virtual gallery on 18th January 2021.  The safety gallery is based on guidelines of United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021-2030, which is divided under five sectors capturing different aspects of road safety. The gallery showcases the projects and awareness drives led by SIAM members, industry stakeholders and multiple other national and international organizations. The primary objective of the virtual gallery is to educate individuals across different age groups about the safety, and drive behavioral change, to make Indian roads safer. The Gallery offers the convenience of viewing the information at a time and location of one’s choice,  in homes, offices, and schools, among others.
 
Many OEMs have partnered in this noble cause of spreading awareness on safe road user behaviour.  Ashok Leyland, Hero MotoCorp, Hyundai Motor India, Mahindra & Mahindra, M G Motors, Skoda Auto Volkswagen India and TATA Motors have already shared the information on Road Safety via videos, presentations etc.

We invite you to visit the gallery and enhance your knowledge on Road Safety.

The link for the same is: https://mela.tv/events/siam/roadsafetyedu-2021. For logging you can use personal details

2/1/21, 11:21 AM - DR Sir WhatsApp No: Dear faculty members 

The number of applications received for admissions 2021-22 in NCR campus is only 434 as on 30th January 2021.
Whereas the application count is 5953 for main campus, Chennai.

According to the present status we are lagging far behind in terms of numbers as well as our admission target.
This indicates that lot of dedicated hardwork needs to be put into admissions.

Let’s start our committed efforts towards admissions and work hard to achieve our targeted numbers.

2/8/21, 7:58 PM - Naresh Sharma: Contact...Connection...सरल भाषा मे समझाया.....तो ऑसू रूक नही पाये.....🤔
एक साधु का न्यूयार्क में बडे पत्रकार 
इंटरव्यू ले रहे थे। 
 
पत्रकार-
सर, आपने अपने लास्ट लेक्चर में 
*संपर्क* (Contact) और
 *संजोग* (Connection)
पर स्पीच दिया लेकिन यह बहुत कन्फ्यूज करने वाला था। क्या आप इसे समझा सकते हैं ?

साधु मुस्कराये और उन्होंने कुछ अलग...
पत्रकारों से ही पूछना शुरू कर दिया।

"आप न्यूयॉर्क से हैं?"

पत्रकार: "Yeah..."

सन्यासी: "आपके घर मे कौन कौन हैं?"

पत्रकार को लगा कि.. साधु उनका सवाल 
टालने की कोशिश कर रहे है क्योंकि 
उनका सवाल बहुत व्यक्तिगत और 
उसके सवाल के जवाब से अलग था।

फिर भी पत्रकार बोला : मेरी "माँ अब नही हैं, पिता हैं तथा 3 भाई और एक बहन हैं !
सब शादीशुदा हैं "

साधू ने चेहरे पे एक मुस्कान के साथ पूछा:
 "आप अपने पिता से बात करते हैं?"

पत्रकार चेहरे से गुस्से में लगने लगा...

साधू ने पूछा, "आपने अपने फादर से 
last कब बात की?"

पत्रकार ने अपना गुस्सा दबाते हुए जवाब दिया : "शायद एक महीने पहले".

साधू ने पूछा: "क्या आप भाई-बहन अक़्सर मिलते हैं? आप सब आखिर में कब मिले 
एक परिवार की तरह ?"

इस सवाल पर पत्रकार के माथे पर पसीना 
आ गया कि , इंटरव्यू मैं ले रहा हूँ या ये साधु ?  
ऐसा लगा साधु, पत्रकार का इंटरव्यू ले रहा है?

एक आह के साथ पत्रकार बोला : "क्रिसमस 
पर 2 साल पहले".

साधू ने पूछा: "कितने दिन आप सब 
साथ में रहे ?"

पत्रकार अपनी आँखों से निकले 
आँसुओं को पोंछते हुये बोला :  "3 दिन..."

साधु: "कितना वक्त आप भाई बहनों ने 
अपने पिता के बिल्कुल करीब बैठ कर गुजारा ?

पत्रकार हैरान और शर्मिंदा दिखा और 
एक कागज़ पर कुछ लिखने लगा... 

साधु ने पूछा: " क्या आपने पिता के साथ नाश्ता , लंच या डिनर लिया ? 
क्या आपने अपने पिता से पूछा के वो कैसे हैँ ?  
माता की मृत्यु के बाद उनका वक्त
 कैसे गुज़र रहा है..... !!
साधु ने पत्रकार का हाथ पकड़ा और कहा: " शर्मिंदा, या दुखी मत होना। 
मुझे खेद है अगर मैंने आपको 
अनजाने में चोट पहुंचाई हो,
 लेकिन ये ही आपके सवाल का जवाब है । *"संपर्क और संजोग"* 
*(Contact and Connection)*

आप अपने पिता के सिर्फ संपर्क
 *(Contact)* में हैं
 ‌पर आपका उनसे कोई 'Connection'  *(जुड़ाव )* नही है।
 *You are not connected to him.*
*आप अपने father से संपर्क में हैं* 
*जुड़े नही है* 

*Connection* हमेशा आत्मा से 
आत्मा का होता है।
 heart से heart होता है। 
एक साथ बैठना, भोजन साझा करना और 
एक दूसरे की देखभाल करना, स्पर्श करना, 
हाथ मिलाना, आँखों का संपर्क होना, 
कुछ समय एक साथ बिताना 

आप अपने  पिता, भाई और बहनों  के 
संपर्क *('Contact')* में हैं लेकिन 
आपका आपस मे कोई' जुड़ाव *'(Connection)* नहीं है".

पत्रकार ने आंखें पोंछी और 
बोला: "मुझे एक अच्छा और अविस्मरणीय 
सबक सिखाने के लिए धन्यवाद".

आज ये भारत की भी सच्चाई हो चली है।
 सबके हज़ारो संपर्क *(contacts)* हैं 
पर  कोई  *connection* नही।
कोई विचार-विमर्श  नहीं।
हर आदमी अपनी नकली दुनियां में 
खोया हुआ है।

वो साधु और कोई नहीं 
*" स्वामी विवेकानंद" थे।”*
     🙏🏻

2/9/21, 2:27 PM - Ranjana Mam: *BREAKING JUST IN*
कैबिनेट ने नई शिक्षा नीति (New Education Policy 2020) को हरी झंडी दे दी है. 34 साल बाद शिक्षा नीति में बदलाव किया गया है. नई शिक्षा नीति की उल्लेखनीय बातें सरल तरीके की इस प्रकार हैं: 
*5 Years Fundamental*
1.  Nursery    @4 Years 
2.  Jr KG        @5 Years
3.  Sr KG        @6 Years
4.  Std 1st     @7 Years 
5.  Std 2nd    @8 Years
*3 Years Preparatory*
6.  Std 3rd     @9 Years 
7.  Std 4th     @10 Years 
8.  Std 5th     @11 Years 
*3 Years Middle*
9.  Std 6th     @12 Years 
10.Std 7th     @13 Years 
11.Std 8th     @14 Years
*4 Years Secondary*
12.Std 9th     @15 Years 
13.Std SSC    @16 Years 
14.Std FYJC  @17Years 
15.STD SYJC @18 Years 
*खास और महत्वपूर्ण बातें* :
*केवल 12वीं क्‍लास में होगा बोर्ड, MPhil होगा बंद, कॉलेज की डिग्री 4 साल की*
*10वीं बोर्ड खत्‍म, MPhil भी होगा बंद,*
*अब 5वीं तक के छात्रों को मातृ भाषा, स्थानीय भाषा और राष्ट्र भाषा में ही पढ़ाया जाएगा. बाकी विषय चाहे वो अंग्रेजी ही क्यों न हो, एक सब्जेक्ट के तौर पर पढ़ाया जाएगा।*
 *अब सिर्फ 12वींं में बोर्ड की परीक्षा देनी होगी. जबकि इससे पहले 10वी बोर्ड की परीक्षा देना अनिवार्य होता था, जो अब नहीं होगा*.
*9वींं से 12वींं क्लास तक सेमेस्टर में परीक्षा होगी. स्कूली शिक्षा को 5+3+3+4 फॉर्मूले के तहत पढ़ाया जाएगा।*
*वहीं कॉलेज की डिग्री 3 और 4 साल की होगी. यानि कि ग्रेजुएशन के पहले साल पर सर्टिफिकेट, दूसरे साल पर डिप्‍लोमा, तीसरे साल में डिग्री मिलेगी.।*
*3 साल की डिग्री उन छात्रों के लिए है जिन्हें हायर एजुकेशन नहीं लेना है. वहीं हायर एजुकेशन करने वाले छात्रों को 4 साल की डिग्री करनी होगी. 4 साल की डिग्री करने वाले स्‍टूडेंट्स एक साल में  MA कर सकेंगे*.
*अब स्‍टूडेंट्स को  MPhil नहीं करना होगा. बल्कि MA के छात्र अब सीधे PHD कर सकेंगे*.
*10वीं में नहीं होगा बोर्ड एग्‍जाम.* 
*स्‍टूडेंट्स बीच में कर सकेंगे दूसरे कोर्स. हायर एजुकेशन में 2035 तक ग्रॉस एनरोलमेंट रेशियो 50 फीसदी हो जाएगा. वहीं नई शिक्षा नीति के तहत कोई छात्र एक कोर्स के बीच में अगर कोई दूसरा कोर्स करना चाहे तो पहले कोर्स से सीमित समय के लिए ब्रेक लेकर वो दूसरा कोर्स कर सकता है.* 
*हायर एजुकेशन में भी कई सुधार किए गए हैं. सुधारों में ग्रेडेड अकेडमिक, ऐडमिनिस्ट्रेटिव और फाइनेंशियल ऑटोनॉमी आदि शामिल हैं. इसके अलावा क्षेत्रीय भाषाओं में ई-कोर्स शुरू किए जाएंगे. वर्चुअल लैब्स विकसित किए जाएंगे. एक नैशनल एजुकेशनल साइंटफिक फोरम (NETF) शुरू किया जाएगा. बता दें कि देश में 45 हजार कॉलेज हैं.*
*सरकारी, निजी, डीम्‍ड सभी संस्‍थानों के लिए होंगे समान नियम।*

*आदेशानुसार:-*

3/8/21, 8:12 AM - Yogesh Kushwaha: महिलाएं सिर्फ शक्ल 
और ज़िस्म से ही खूबसूरत नहीं होती,,
बल्कि वो इसलिए भी खूबसूरत होती हैं,।
क्योंकि प्यार में ठुकराने के बाद भी ... 
किसी लड़के पर तेजाब नहीं फेंकती ! 
उनकी वज़ह से कोई लड़का 
दहेज़ में प्रताड़ित हो कर फांसी नहीं लगाता !
वो इसलिए भी खूबरसूरत होती हैं,,
कि उनकी वजह से किसी लड़के को 
रास्ता नही बदलना पड़ता! 
वो राह चलते लड़को पर 
अभद्र टिप्पड़ियां नही करती! 
वो इसलिए भी खूबसूरत होती हैं,, कि देर से घर आने वाले पति पर 
शक नही करती,,
बल्कि फ़िक्र करती है! 
वो छोटी छोटी बातों पर 
गुस्सा नही होती, 
सामान नही पटकती, 
हाथ नही उठाती,
बल्कि पार्टनर को समझाने की,
भरपूर कोशिश करती हैं !
वो जुर्म सह कर भी 
रिश्ते इसलिए निभा जाती हैं,,
क्योंकि वो अपने बूढ़े माँ बाप का 
दिल नही तोड़ना चाहती ! 
वो हालात से समझौता 
इसलिए भी कर जाती हैं, 
क्योंकि उन्हें अपने बच्चों के 
उज्ज्वल भविष्य की फ़िक्र होती है ! 
वो रिश्तों में जीना चाहती हैं ! 
रिश्ते निभाना चाहती हैं ! 
रिश्तों को अपनाना चाहती हैं!
दिलों को जीतना चाहती हैं ! 
प्यार पाना चाहती हैं ! 
प्यार देना चाहती हैं !.
हमसफ़र, हमकदम बनाना चाहती हैं।
Dedicated to all lovely sweet and Respected ladies 
Happy women day 
Always stay blessed and be Happy

हे शंकरजी, मेरी आत्मा आप हैं। मेरी बुद्धि आपकी शक्ति पार्वतीजी हैं। मेरे प्राण आपके गण हैं। मेरा यह पंच भौतिक शरीर आपका मंदिर है। संपूर्ण विषय भोग की रचना आपकी पूजा ही है। मैं जो सोता हूं, वह आपकी ध्यान समाधि है। मेरा चलना-फिरना आपकी परिक्रमा है। मेरी वाणी से निकला प्रत्येक उच्चारण आपके स्तोत्र व मंत्र हैं। इस प्रकार मैं आपका भक्त जिन-जिन कर्मों को करता हूं, वह आपकी आराधना ही है।

शिवरात्रि की अनेकक्षशुभकामनाएँ💐

Director ITKM with the input from IQAC released the TeamDeck portal where teaching/non-teaching staff, deans, directors, and all other administrators have been requested to upload their details which will serve as a single place from which all data pertaining to staff can be extracted.
Though more than 6 months have elapsed, more than 3800  staff (teaching, non-teaching, administrators et al.) have not entered their data. This is being viewed very seriously. In absence of reliable data, Registrar's office, IQAC, and others keep asking for data repeatedly from the staff for NIRF/AQAR/QS, etc.
Therefore all are requested to enter/update the data in the TeamDeck portal on or before 20th March 2021.
Your wholehearted cooperation is requested.

3/26/21, 8:19 AM - Ankit Auto HOD: An exclusive *BBC interview* with the *founder of Dubai Sheik Rashid al Maktoum,* about Dubai. When they asked him about the future of his country and he said " *My father was on a camel, I'm in a Mercedes, my son is in a Land Rover, and my grandson is going to be in a Land Rover, but my great grandson will be back on a camel"*

Why is that? they asked..

He replied " *Tough times create strong men, strong men create easy times. Easy times create weak men, weak men create tough times* ” 

Many won't understand but you have to *raise warriors, not parasites*"

Please appreciate the words.
